97956,11,Pearlie,female,Caucasian/White,QLD,Australia,1995,January,1999,January,"Patient experiences excruciating pain in the middle of the symphysis pubis (lasts only a second, but affects whole body and causes severe emotional response). This pain happens randomly and patient has no warning (though it tends to occur when she makes quick movements where she twists, like turning over in bed etc).

Earliest memory patient has of this particular pain is back when she was approx 4 years old. She experienced incidents of this pain maybe a few times a year (patient was a dancer, gymnast, and swimmer) up until about 2007. Before 2007, the pain would occur randomly over a few hours but would eventually subside and disappear with rest and Panadol. But in 2007 (age 12), she turned over in bed and got the pain, but this time it did not subside and continued to develop into constant pelvic pains and she was told to cease all sports and physical exercise until it resolved.

Since 2007, patient has not been able to return to any sport or exercise (including light jogging and running). Though she does not have that 10/10 pain constantly, she would get it at least once a day and could not even perform everyday tasks such as putting on underwear. This pain has always been accompanied by extreme distress and fear and has influenced every decision she has had to make in her life, even today. She has seen several specialists and been tested for multiple conditions and have never been given a clear diagnosis, but definitely theories that seem to make sense. 

Patient is so affected by this condition that she developed major depressive disorder and has attempted to take her life on many occasions, the latest being 16th Jan 2021 after a 10/10 pain incident occurred.

Allergies: shellfish, CT contrast dye

Illnesses/conditions: migraines, major depressive disorder, sleeve gastrectomy, IBS, optic neuritis

Medications: Cymbalta 60mg (since 2008), Isotretinoin 10mg, Microlut, Aspalgin (when needed), panadeine forte (for PRP treatments)

Family history: rheumatoid arthritis (mum’s side), asthma (dad’s side), migraines (both), depression (dad’s side), asthma (dad’s side)

 

1998/1999      first experience of the 10/10 pain (caused by jumping on tiled floors? Memory not as strong)


2000-2003      10/10 pain incidents during school, sports, and dancing (jumping + twist at same time, bomb diving into pool etc.)

2004                checked for rheumatoid arthritis – results inconclusive

2005                multiple pain incidents during school, sports, and dancing

2006                more frequent pain incidents – had to cut back on dancing, stopped sports

2007                worst pain incident that didn’t get better (turned over in bed). MRI showed inflammation around symphysis pubis. Saw orthopaedic surgeon. Told to stop all exercise and sports and rest. Used crutches to support walking. Began to miss school frequently. Started anti-inflammatories. Weight gain.

2008                diagnosed with major depressive disorder and generalised anxiety disorder. Missed a lot of highschool. Saw sports physio. Remained on anti-inflammatories. Received cortisone injections to heads of both adductors – provided a lot of relief, but not enough to return to regular movement or dancing. Did physio sessions but experience pain performing exercises and struggled mentally to perform them. Began seeing psych. 

2009                Received cortisone injections again to heads of both adductors – no relief or change in pain. MRI shows no more inflammation.

2009-2011      Missed almost complete terms of school due to pain and depression/anxiety. Returned to see ortho.Told condition was ‘spinal wind-up’ – no structural problem just brain creating pain? Told to do 'exercise' but no specifics

2012                Began experiencing sharp lower back pain (still present today). Given exercises by physio but experienced pain while completing them and physio ceased practice.

2013/2014      Exercise physiology sessions (struggled to do them due to pain and fear).

2015                Saw spine doctor who performed marcane injected directly to symphysis pubis. Then had ultrasound-guided cortisone injection to symphysis pubis – no relief or change to pain. Tested for PCOS, endometriosis, rheumatoid arthritis (nothing). Saw gynaecologist who did not find anything to explain pain.

2016                Had pain incident which caused depressive episode and 1st attempt of suicide. Came home to family and did not complete Masters.

2016                Underwent sleeve gastrectomy. Lost to date approx. 45kg. Depression improved.

2016                 Physio sessions – first theory of sacroiliac joint causing a lot of problems. Given specific exercises which changed pain, but didn’t relieve it. Could not continue physio due to cost. Blood tests did not indicate rheumatoid/spondylitis.

2017/2018      Saw neurologist who suggested functional movement sessions and SIJ block (also believed SIJs were a problem). Depression worsened – hospitalised for anxiety attacks. Did not have SIJ block. Saw gynaecologist for painful vulval area - diagnosed with vulvodynia but told it was not related to pelvic pain.

2019                Saw back doctor who suggested that SIJs were referring pain to pubic area. Performed PRP to both SIJ joints – pain changed, but didn’t lessen. Also supported idea that SIJs may have been upset by fall when she was a young kid because it was not logical for a 4 year old to have neuropathic pain.

2019                Continued PRP and prolotherapy treatments with pain specialist who believed that SIJs were responsible for pain, but problem was lax ligaments and not the joint themselves? Improvement  from first few rounds of treatment, but plateaued.

2019                Bad pain 10/10 incident during work (from simple movements like walking etc.)

2020                Continued PRP and prolotherapy treatments. Saw exercise physiologists and began exercises. Definitely felt strength return, but physiologists didn’t seem to understand that she was not feeling mentally ready to move on to new exercises only after a week or so (physically was progressing, but felt like her brain needed more time to adjust). Stopped seeing ex physiologists. Had bad experiences with jobs and was unemployed for a while. Began psychology sessions.

2020 -2021               Many episodes of back pain and depressive episodes. Unable to apply for many jobs due to condition and fear of pain.","Hand, Foot and Mouth (approx 1997/1998)","Bowel cancer on both sides of family.

89208,41,Nichol,female,The Netherlands,Noord-Holland,Netherlands,1995,April,2009,January,"At te age of 14 it started with a very heavy sharp pain cramps in my legs. 
At this age, my condition was already very bad, I couldn't do everything at school when we had gym classes. I was out of breath very fast.
When I was 18, I still had the pain in my legs, (a few times in a week). But then I also had this weird symptom: fever. After a short walk, shower, doing groceries or any other light efforts, I started sweating a LOT, and I would gave fever. (around 38.3 celcius)
After a short walk, I need to sit down, so that the fever will go down, and have my body back on temperature (which happens most of the time in 1 hour) 
After a 10 minute walk I am completely exhausted and sweating a lot. 
A very important symptome also is that I am feeling tired/exhausted almost any time. I sleep around 13 hours every day. 
I have been several times at the first aid at the hospital, because I had so much pain in my muscles, I didn't know what to do with the pain anymore. (Mostly in the legs, and back, but also in my arms, fingers, shoulders, neck, in my face, hips, almost everywhere.) Well, they just send me home with a lot of painkillers, but they never could find a diagnosis.
I also have several other symptoms like: 
-sleeping hands or arms tingle at night
-stomach problems, (nauseous or the need of throwing up)
- bowel problems (yellow diarrhea)
- headache
- dizzyness
- acne
- burning skin (feet/arms/legs)
- balance disorder (I can not stand on one feet or walk in a straight line) 
- flat feet, I have special shoe soles for this
- worn in the lower back
- short memory loss

But the main symptoms are the heavy pain in my muscles, tiredness, and the sweating. 
If I have a good day, I can work 2 hours a day, but sometimes Im in so much pain or so tired that I have to be in bed. 

I had 2 surgery's, one benign tumor in my liver 9 centimiters (FNH) and a benign tumor in my breast (2 centimeters)

I diagnosis would mean so much to me, It would help me to life further in my life, now im living in uncertainty because I don't know what is wrong with me, and I am only 24 years old. I have seen so many doctors but they don't know what is going on, and they can not give me a diagnosis.

My blood test are always good, also the MRI of my brains and upper body. 

Please help me think about a diagnosis so that I can life with my disease in peace.","I have been to a lung specialist, neurologist, dermatologist, internist, rheumatologist, gynecologist, 
endocrinologist, orthodontist, cardiologist, rehabilitation doctor, I have seen a lot of doctors.

Surgical procedures:
They removed an benign tumor in my liver, and a benign tumor in my breast. 

Diagnoses from a doctor:
Sleeping disorder, fibromyalgie. (I totally don't believe the last one, I am SURE that there is something else going on)","I am adopted, so I don't know anything about my real family/ diseases in the family.","When I have a good day, I try to have a short walk (15 minutes) with my mother. 
For the rest of the week, Im giving private teaching lessons to students, a few hours a week.
I have to go to bed again, after I wake up in the morning because Im still tired. 
Im not smoking, Sometimes I drink a few glasses of wine in the weekend, and I try to eat healthy food.",,"My illness has a lot of impact in my life. I can't do the things a 24 years old person wants to do. (I can't go out without being exhausted, or without pain) 
I have to take bed-rest a lot, and also a lot of painkillers.

65048,7,Brock,male,Caucasian/White,Florida,United States,1990,June,2020,June,"I have been experiencing symptoms of chronic dry mouth and unusual stools for over 6 months. The symptoms began 13 days after a sexual encounter with a man of unknown sexual or medical history. 

The man was in his early 50s and is a self-proclaimed bisexual. I performed and received unprotected oral sex from the man, and received analingus (oral-anal contact) from the man. I did not receive penetrative anal sex, though he engaged in frotteurism on my anus. I did not perform oral-anal contact on the man. He and I performed deep kissing. During the deep kissing, I noted that the man had a hairy, white tongue, and dry mouth which tasted metallic (much as my mouth does now).

13 days after the sexual experience, symptoms began to manifest. Over the course of one day (roughly 12 hours), my mouth went dry and a thick layer developed on my tongue and the back of my throat (later confirmed not to be fungal). Oral and gastrointestinal symptoms were greatest from this initial reaction for roughly 2-3 weeks. Symptoms during that period included:
•	severe dry mouth
•	white tongue/hairy tongue (could be scraped with fingernail)
•	general feeling of malaise
•	diarrhea (3-4 bowel movements daily)
     o	stool was yellow or light brown in color, watery or runny, loose and sometimes floated, smelled sweet or pungent, oftentimes greasy
•	weight loss over the course of 2-3 weeks (roughly 15lbs)
•	anorexia/loss of appetite
•	flatulence 
•	stomach cramping (generally attributed to flatulence)
•	slightly swollen lymph nodes in neck (lasting only 2-3 days)
•	mild night sweats (easily treated by removing clothing)
•	dry eye (although I have had dry eyes for years they became worse at the onset of the above symptoms)
•	headaches
•	mild dizziness that would come and go
•	“alkaline” feel throughout the mouth and body (I used to develop canker sores from eating acidic foods, and had frequent acid reflux – all of which stopped after symptom onset)
•	Dry eyes (I have always had dry eyes but symptoms became more severe during this period)
During this initial period I also developed a small staph infection on my knee, which I drained easily and healed. Also during the last week of symptoms, I developed a fungal infection around my naval, which I healed by keeping the area dry and clean
After the 2-3 week period (roughly one month after sexual contact), symptoms began to ebb. The diarrhea stopped, although unusual stools continue. I began to gain weight back, dry eye lessened, dry mouth lessened but continued, white tongue receded a little, headaches stopped, malaise stopped, night sweats stopped.

I underwent testing and treatment for routine diseases by my PCP, gastroenterologist, ENT, Infectious Disease doctor, and several doctors at a walk in clinic:
•	Walk in clinic, treated for suspected oral thrush with Nyastatin, Clotrimazole, and Fluconazole – no effect
•	ENT confirmed oral issue was not oral thrush, ordered tests for Sjogren’s and rheumatic factor 1 month from onset of symptoms – all normal, no antibodies detected
•	Infectious disease doctor tested for HIV viral load and antibody, and EBV – negative for HIV and antibodies; EBV antigen IgM negative, IgG positive, and EBNA igG positive (1.5 months from sexual encounter)
     o	Infectious disease doctor diagnosed tongue as “hairy tongue” and prescribed Magic Mouthwash 10 days – no change in symptoms
•	PCP tested for Syphilis, Chlamydia, Gonorrhea, Trichomonas, HIV, herpes 1 & 2, Hepatitis A, B, and C at 2 weeks, 1 month, 2 months, and 3 months from sexual encounter – all negative
     o	Subsequent testing for viral loads for Hepatitis B and C, Titer tests for Syphilis, and viral loads for HIV all came back negative
     o	Gonorrhea and Chlamydia treatment given at my request in case they were not detected through urine (infection in mouth or anus) – Doxycycline 100mg 2x 10 days, 500mg ceftriaxone. No effect on symptoms
     o	No treatment for Trichomonas, although oral or anal exposure remains ambiguous
•	After the main symptoms subsided and the diarrhea subsided, I submitted a stool sample to my gastroenterologist (2 months from sexual encounter) to understand why the stools were still abnormal in color, texture, etc. 
     o	Initial stool test came back negative for parasites, PCR positive for c. diff. Treatment given at recommendation of doctor, Vancomycin 250mg 3x 10 days. No change in symptoms
     o	Retested for c. diff after Vancomycin. Negative for toxins, positive again for PCR. Given Dificid 200mg 2x 10 days. No effect on stool quality
•	Returned to PCP for follow up stool tests to test for parasites in case they were the main cause of my unusual stools and dry mouth. 
     o	Subsequent stool samples negative for parasites
     o	Negative for Giardia antibodies and Giargia in stool
     o	Negative for Campylobacter, E. Coli, Salmonella, Shiga, Crytosporidium and Cycolspora
•	At onset of symptoms, PCP tested urinalysis and lipid panel.
     o	Urinalysis all normal
     o	 Glucose slightly elevated (99), alt (sgpt) high (51), total cholesterol 412, triglycerides 150, LDL 334 (this was all to be expected as I have a family history of high cholesterol and have been treated for it in the past). Placed on atorvastatin 20mg
•	At 5 months from onset of symptoms, PCP retested for lipids
     o	Glucose 109, alt (sgpt) high (52), total cholesterol 211, triglycerides 100, LDL 142. Continuing treatment with Atorvastatin 20mg

At present, more than six months from sexual encounter, I am still struggling with symptoms:
•	Dry mouth (less severe than before but still present)
•	White tongue/hairy tongue (less severe but still present)
•	Dizziness that comes and goes
•	Unusual stools (light brown or yellow stools, stools that float, greasy stools)
•	""Alkaline"" feeling in mouth and body (metallic taste in mouth, no IBS, no acid reflux)

I am having no other gastrointestinal issues and diet does not effect the quality of the stools. I do not have acid reflux, indigestion,","I have had one surgery on each lower eyelid due to styes developing into chalazions, whereby I had to have them surgically drained. This may contribute to my usual dry eye.

I once had a chronic hordeolum (sty) in my right lower lid which did not drain and lasted for 8 months due to continuous misdiagnosis by 4 doctors. It was eventually cured with a 10 day of doxycyline.

I have high cholesterol (mostly from diet but also hereditary), treated with Atorvastatin

I had nodular cystic acne on my shoulders and back which was treated with 6 months of Accutane (70mg Isotretinoin). The treatment has left my eyes and skin dryer than before beginning treatment, but is very easy to treat with lotions and eye drops

I used to wear contact lenses 10 years prior to now, but have ceased due to capillary damage in both eyes (from overuse of the contact lenses). This has contributed to dry eye; dry eye has been treated with Omega-3","I have one older sister with no medical issues

Father is otherwise healthy aside from high cholesterol and elevated blood pressure

Mother died from breast cancer 2016 at the age of 63

Maternal Grandmother had diabetes, easily controlled through diet

Paternal Grandfather died of lung cancer; had nodular cystic acne","I have high cholesterol, mainly from a diet of high-fat, processed fast-food. Lifestyle is sedentary aside from job where I stand around 8 hour daily. I consume 3-4 caffeinated sodas daily (although I know this and my diet should change). I do not excerise at the moment due to a hip imbalance, but am able to walk for 1+ miles with no ill effects. I do not drink. I do not use tobacco or marijuana products. I do not use any form of recreational drugs. I have no history of STIs. I am 25% BMI for my height (5' 6'')","Of all tests to be run, almost all tests have come back negative. Rheumatism is normal, no antibodies for Sjogren's have been found (yet), no STDs can be found, there seem to be no parasitic pathogens in stool (multiple samples taken). In the event that a urine sample did not catch Chlamydia or Gonorrhea (if there was an anal or oral infection), I was treated for both with no improvement in symptoms.

For the hairy tongue and dry mouth, I was originally diagnosed with Candida/oral thrush but treatments of Nyastatin, Clotrimazole, Fluconazole failed. ENT confirmed it was not oral thrush. Infectious diseases doctor thought it was caused by an allergen and prescribed Magic Mouthwash to no effect.

The only tests to come back positive or abnormal are Epstein Barr virus antibodies are positive, and cholesterol are high (which was the case long before all of this began). ALT (SGPT) is high (52) and glucose levels are high (109). LDL and Triglycerides are high. Also tested positive for c diff, but only after diarrhea began to go away.

I have been treated for c. diff., however, due to ongoing symptoms and mildness of symptoms from onset, the doctor and I both believe that the c. diff. tests may have been false positives or detected non-toxigenic strains of c. diff. PCR tests had come back positive but Toxic antigen tests came back negative. Originally treated with Vancomycin 250 3x daily for 10 days to no effect (although diarrhea had effectively ceased by the time I was being treated for c. diff, but loose stools, unusually smelling stools, and discolored stools persisted) and then treated with Dificid mg 2x daily for 10 days (this also had no effect).","Because this illness seems to be the result of a sexual encounter done against my own values, I have been dealing with tremendous amounts of guilt and shame. Though the illness itself hasn't affected my daily life too much, I am terrified that this may be a sexually transmitted pathogen and I refuse to make sexual contact with another person until this is resolved, or, identified. My greatest fear is transmitting this to another person.","As I once had a chronic infection in my right lower eyelid for 8 months without pain, resolved with Doxycicline.Pain has never been a good indicator for me if there is some kind of infection.",Head or neck,Chronic Dry Mouth,,False,,120000,False,False,True,Standard,Standard,2021-01-08T20:49:01.587Z,56900c60fe4df003009d3fa2,32,2 years 1 months ago,"Florida, United States",554,{},"{""quality"": {""total"": 123, ""count"": 31}, ""difficulty"": {""total"": 94, ""count"": 28}}",21000,[],[],[],"[""5ff9801ce5b64700049f27c8"", ""5ffa18c39b2e15000438929c"", ""5ffa31622aa7390004cddd6a"", ""6154b2ab7d11150004dd0461""]",[],"[{""_id"": ""5fe159c42ee77c0004284fe1"", ""explanation"": ""Unusual stools (sometimes loose, sometimes solid, varying in color between light brown and yellow, sometimes gassy and floating sometimes not, increased flatulence).\n\nI used to have mild acid reflux and occasional indigestion from eating very spicy foods.

86807,20,Debera,female,Caucasian/White,South Carolina,United States,1970,May,1970,May,"In infancy, burning upon urination with red/purple vulva. In 1st grade I was unable to run due to pain. Scoliosis, S-curvature with a rotation at the watershed was found. Now I have a rotation at all three levels of the spine. I have always been sensitive to light, sound, vibration, touch, heat, and now I am intolerant to both heat and cold, light touch and hypersensitive to pain.

At 14 I was semi-paralyzed from the neck down (idiopathic) for four months and woke one day ready to go skating. I had a sore throat and just felt like lead and tired all over.

At 23 I had a ruptured ectopic pregnancy misdiagnoses caused by mirror image pain. A second ectopic at 25 a die injection showed my fallopian tube was contracted and narrowed. 

At 30 a minor toe surgery led to a massive Complex Regional Pain Syndrome episode. Very high doses of Neurontin, low dose Amitriptyline, and Lidocaine broke the CRPS cycle. The foot and leg look normal, but the neuropathic pain remains systemically. Same as childhood but more pronounced, with pain that feels like muscle cramps down both legs from the waist down. I have a head/neck tremor since my early 20s that is slowly spreading into my shoulders and torso.

Headaches that feel vascular in temples, sagittal sinus, and transverse sinus areas. I have experienced tinnitus and eye pain for about two years now. I was near-sighted with astigmatism in both years from childhood. I had lasik in 2016 that has done well, but I need to have another procedure to adjust the acuity, but my eyes hurt too bad to consider it at this time.

I have CD disks of images from x-ray of spine 2018 , MRI brain from 2018, MRI brain from 2019, MRA brain arteries from 2019, CT abdomen 2019, and bone density from 2019 that I am happy to share.

The MRIs show small vessel ischemia, subdural hematomas, the MRA show bilateral Posterior Communication Artery hypoplasia. There are some kind of lesions in the mastoid cell, the sphenoid sinus and the crista galli. 

I have always had a variable anemia (normo-hyperchromic and normo-macrocytic). I have fat red blood cells. I had my whole genome sequenced and there are four SNPs that are pathogenetic for acute myeloid leukemia with maturation. There are other pathogenic genes found in Clinvar, but none of them have a high confidence rating at this time. I am happy to share the genetic information with you as well.","1.    Born with a vaginal redness and urinary burning that would come and go from birth until around 7 years old. Now it is suspected that Scoliosis causes the tailbone to place pressure on the nerves that run to the urinary tract. This recurs from time to time but not often and is easy to get under control with lidocaine.
 
2.    5 years old: I was exposed to Chicken Pox but had a very mild response… like one or two bumps near my belly button… my poor brother had them everywhere.
 
3.    7 years old: I was told to walk or run a mile at school. I made it 1/10th of a mile, sat down on the track and cried. The school nurse told my mother that I had scoliosis, but it would never cause any problems, so it was not evaluated until much later. Last year. X-ray shows The long, skinny s-curve that had one rotation at the thoracic, now has two additional rotations… one at cervical, thoracic, and lumbar levels of the spine.
 
4.    11 years old: all my molars had pin-hole cavities (2-3 on each tooth. I had to have 2 root canals and over 30 cavities filled that year. It was awful! I was being given up to 17 shots a sitting to numb the tooth for the root canals, and I had to go to 5 or 6 visits for each root canal, because of the pain. The sound of a dental drill still makes me shutter and want to run away.
 
5.    14 years old: After significant, prolonged stress, I had something that looked like Mono, but after about two weeks it was obvious it was not a virus. I was prescribed an antibiotic that resulted in a Steven-Johnston Syndrome reaction. My glands were swollen, my throat was awful sore, and now both hands had blistered, peeled, and were raw and itching. I was a hot mess and woke one morning unable to lift my arms and legs. I could wiggle my fingers, but my body felt like it weighted 300 lbs to lift or move. I remained that way (my hands healed normally) for about 3 months, and woke one day ready to go skating, as if nothing had ever happened.
 
6.    18 years old: I caught the flu for the first time ever and had a pretty bad time with it. Was prescribed an antibiotic and had a severe anaphylaxis shock reaction with a grand mal seizure.
 
7.    19 years old: live birth of twin boys (4lbs 11oz & 6lbs 1oz) via C-section.
 
8.    23 years old: I doubled over in fits of pain that felt like a severe muscle spasm in my left abdomen. After four months of being called a hypochondriac, my right fallopian tube and ovary ruptured from an ectopic pregnancy. I bled slowly until I reach organ spasms and impending sense of doom. I died on the bed being rushed to the OR. The cause was determined to be narrowed fallopian tube from what seemed to be contracted muscles.
 
9.    25 years old: A second ectopic pregnancy was detected and removed via laparoscopy.
 
10.    29 to 31 years old: My pinky toe on my right foot was tucking under my foot and it was causing pain. The podiatrists diagnosed Hammer Toe and scheduled surgery. The surgery went well, the little bone removed, and the surgeon noticed something that looked unusual. He further incised the opening and pierced a very large pocket of E. Coli infection that had apparently pooled in that foot and thankfully was encased. The wound was left open and was packed for irrigation and ensuring the bacterial infection was cured. About 30 days later, the surgery to close the surgical wound and start the real healing process took place. The foot healed normally for about 45 days after that surgery, and then the RSD/CRPS neuropathy and allodynia took off like wildfire up to my thigh. In the process of diagnostics, bariatric chamber, TENS, and nerve blocks at 6 or 7 locations did nothing to help. The TENS made matters much worse. After the absolute worst year and a half of my life, laughter, Gabapentin in very high doses (4800mg/day), and a Lidocaine (12%), Amitriptyline (3%) petroleum compound gave me back my foot and leg. During that time the neuropathic pain spread back to my urinary tract with vaginal burning and then to my teeth and 15 molars were extracted to spare my sanity. Large boils had to be surgically removed from the “leg pits” … don’t laugh at me, because I have no idea what else to call that area of the body, maybe the groin. 
 
11.    37 years old: I graduated my bachelor’s program and went to the beach for the weekend. I did not lay out in the sun but was getting reflective UV light off the beach and it was hotter than I was tolerating well. Within a week of returning home my face had broken out in a boil-like acne similar to the boils that were removed on my legs. I have had unusual hair growth and sensory issues on my face since then.
 
12.    43 years old: I was living in New Orleans and caught Chicken Pox. It was a mild case, but more spread than what I had as a child. (Slidell, LA)
 
13.    43 years old: I had an idiopathic case of pancreatitis that made me bargain with God for seven days. (Slidell, LA)
 
14.    46 years old: Stress led to chest pain. I was stress tested and my heart is healthy according to that set of tests. (Inova in Alexandria, VA)
 
15.    48 years old: Stem Cell therapy to re-innervate muscles that have hardened in my neck and to regain feeling in my back between my shoulder blades.

16.   49 years old: Kidney stone with transferred pain that did not respond too opioids. It took gabapentin, heating pad and lidocaine to be able to survive the pain as the very tiny (maybe 2 mm) stone moved through the system.
 
16.    Very slow computational speed.
​
17. Current Symptoms
a.    Severe headaches 
b.    My eyes hurt.
c.    Sore throats from time to time 
d.    The tinnitus is maddening. Any noise with a higher pitch triggers it. In 2012 my hearing was tested, and I hear better than dogs. I have never had a silent moment in my life. 
e.    I am having pain from my belly button down (predominately on the back of my legs) with noticeable swelling (at times) behind both knees. I still have allodynia and burning sensations on my feet. 
f.    Pressure (from sitting or touching) on the back of my legs is very painful at times
g.    I have been a dalmatian of hot and cold spots for decades. I used to tolerate heat, but not cold. Now I cannot tolerate either heat or cold. In the heat I itch so bad from head to toe that I feel like I am being eaten alive by chiggers. In the cold my shiver response is extreme and muscles get so exhausted. The muscles spasm worse in the cold, but summer air conditioning causes the same symptoms. Winter heating requires me to use a humidifier all winter to prevent extreme painful, dry eyes.
h.    I have had a significant head and neck tremor for decades. 
i.    My startle response is extreme. 
j.    My neck pops a dozen of more times a day.
k.     I do not tolerate exercise at all. 
l.    I am not able to stand on my feet for more than 5 or so minutes at a time. 
m.    I cannot lift much weight, and not repetitively (my muscles are not as strong as they used to be, but I have more trouble with endurance than with strength). 
n.    I have phantom pan in the missing molars and all the remaining teeth hurt like mad.
o.     I have seriously bad orthostatic hypotension. I fell in 2018 from stooping down, and I broke my tailbone. 
p.    I am chronically fatigued but have so much pain that sleeping is very hard to do.
q.    I am ill as the entire hornet’s nest. I have been homeless and financially destroyed so many times in my lifetime that I have lost count. I am anxious, angry, and terrified… which is normal under the circumstances.
r.    I have nightmares often, especially when I drive. When I drive, I dream I am having one car crash after another all night long for a few days. Otherwise, it is stupid stuff that causes me to startle and wake. I also have night sweats (typically in the summer, and not as bad in the winter) and have a hard time keeping my body temperature in such a way to be able to sleep well.
s.    My abdominal organs hurt… chest pain, pancreas, spleen, liver, kidneys and intestines. The internal pain comes and goes but is severe enough to put me in the bed every time it happens.
t.    It is hard to list symptoms, because they run around my body like squirrels chasing nuts.","Mother has had breast cancer, tinnitus, kidney stones.

Grandmother (mother) and brother has had prolapsed valve.

Grandmother (father) colon cancer

Father and brother and grandfather (mother) died at early age of heart failure (alcoholic). I do not drink, except rarely, and do not have alcoholic tendencies at all.

It hurts to ride in a car, noises are hard to manage, smells are assaulting. I go to the grocery store, and out to eat a few times a week.

37488,44,Kayla,female,White/ caucasian,Florida,United States,1985,May,2014,May,"In May 2014, I noticed feeling unrelenting fatigue, heart palpitations, brain fog and generally unwell. Eventually this progressed to the point where my heart rate began clocking in at 170, even while at rest. After being bed bound for a year and seeing many cardiologists, I was finally diagnosed with nuerocardogenic syncope and dysautonomia in 2015 via a positive tilt table exam. After another tilt table in 2017 and feeling like I met the requirements for POTS, I saw one of U.S.'s leading experts on this condition and was subsequently diagnosed with POTS and inappropriate sinus tachycardia. My heart rate responded very well to atenolol but I was still left feeling generally unwell. Although I was able to function with leaving the home, driving and doing basic errands, I would get strange attacks throughout the course of my POTS diagnosis. At first they would happen a few times a year where all the sudden my HR would spike from 70-140 in a matter of seconds. I would be left with a strange feeling of doom prior to this episode happening. During the episodes, which lasted a matter of minutes, I literally felt like I was dying.  I've been able to capture my BP going up to 160/110 during these episodes and I'm normally 100/70 in the afternoon and 86/63 in the morning because of POTS. The episodes usually involve a sudden bowel movement or diarrhea either before or after the episode. Another episode woke me up in the middle of the night, when I got off atenolol and was trying Corlanor as a new medication. The same thing happened and all returned back to normal. I brought these episodes up with my doctors, telling them I was concerned but they brushed me off. Because these episodes only happened a few times a year, I let them slide even though they were incredibly jarring. This October I had a glass for red wine for the first time in many years and and had another identical episode but this time it lasted about 3 hours long. During the episode, my HR got up to 150 even on atenolol, my BP was 160/110 and in addition to having a feeling of doom and multiple bowel movements I was also dealing with extreme nausea. Although I did not throw up, I was dry heaving several times during this one. I assumed the wine triggered something, but about a month later I had another episode of this and I had no wine in my system or anything else I think would be triggering. This one lasted about ten minutes, woke me up again about an hour after I had fallen asleep with a sudden, extreme nausea, high HR and BP, a sudden urge to have a bowel movement, I also became incredibly thirsty, pale, had the chills (no fever) and my hands were shaking violently. Since the onset of the attack with the wine, I'm now having these attacks several times a week. Some days not at all, but some days up to twice in a day. They usually happen in the middle of the night and last under 10 minutes and I have to spend time recovering depending on how long and how severe the attack was. My providers want to keep medicating me for ""POTS"" but I feel these symptoms are either the result of an illness or problem that would explain the root cause of my POTS or are another medical situation entirely in addition to the POTS. My only other medical condition is Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome which I was diagnosed with recently by a geneticist. When these attacks started initially, I was screened for a pheocromocytoma as I resonated with the description of those attacks, but was negative.",At the onset of the illness I was diagnosed with POTS and two other forms of dysautonomia (IST and NCS). I also received a diagnosis of EDS type 3 from a geneticist so I had that my entire life but just learned about it.,"Diabetes type 2 from maternal grandmother
aortic valve replacement father","I lived a normal life prior to this illness. I had a job, lived independently, had a relationship and many friends. I had good energy, no prior health issues  (aside from the EDS, which I didn't know and had no problems from) and ran 4 miles at the gym 3 times a week. I also did strength training 2 times a week.","Tilt table 2015- Neurocardogenic syncope, dysautonomia

       I would like to start by thanking whoever has taken time out of there day to read this and try their best to help me. I greatly appreciate it. 
	
		My symptoms started about a year and half ago I was at the gym and i did my normal warm up for 5 minutes on the treadmill and i came down a flight of stairs and i was planning on doing some chest on this day. 
              So i started off with a light weight on the incline bench. I picked up the 20 lb dumbbells' and started warming up with it and as soon as i got up to put the weight back im guessing due to the positional change my body wasn't able to normally get blood to my brain and i started having tachycardia and felt like i was going to faint. It felt like a presyncopal episode  since i felt like almost blacking out but didn't and this had never happened to me before and i had been going to gym now for a couple years. 
           I thought maybe i needed some fluid so i tried drinking some Gatorade but it wouldn't go down so i just sat down and hoped things would get better but unfortunately they didn't. I ended the workout and went home hoping things would get better but they started spiraling downwards quickly.
              From this day on i started feeling extremely hungry even though i was eating a lot upwards of 4000 calories. I was not able to sleep at night,  i would get up with night sweats and feeling hungry. I also was feeling constipated and was suggested to take some miralax which just made things worse and did nothing for the constipation. 
        As days passed i was feeling weaker and weaker especially in my legs. Also i started having palpitations which i had never had before and the palpitations would come on whenever i exerted myself like going up a flight of stairs. Fasting for a lab became challenging as i was so hungry all the time. 
I also was feeling very hot all the time, sweating more than usual and i felt my body was vasodilated and my legs, arms stomach were hot to the touch. Had all the initial blood tests and were normal and the doctor told me i was feeling anxious. I told him that im not an anxious person but he wouldn't listen and i told him that being so weak in a couple of days doesn't seem like a symptom of anxiety.
               
             ___Doctors I have seen___

              The primary care doctor then sent me to a cardiologist and he did an echocardiogram and my heart was normal. We also did a Holter meter which was normal as well so he suggested it might be POTS so he recommended me to see a neurologist since i was having bouts of dizziness and tachycardia. 
             In the meantime since i was also having my issues like constipation, reflux i met with a gastroenterologist and he did an endoscopy and a sigmoidoscopy which were both normal and he told me nothing was wrong with me. He also checked for H pylori which was negative
             Also went to an endocrinologist to have my hormones' checked and they were all normal as well. Had a sleep study done since i was having problems with sleep as well and that was normal as well.
               Went to the neurologist and got a tilt table test but was negative so i was put on some propranolol for the palpitations which did calm the palpitations but didn't help in any other way. Since something like this had never happened to me and it literally turned my life upside down  leaving me with not being able to do anything so i started feeling depressed and thought maybe it is in my head as i was being told by everyone. I met with a psychiatrist and tried a variety of medications which did nothing for me or my mood.
               Even tried TMS which didn't help but in the end it was just time that helped and self reflection and looking around and realizing how some people have it even worse than I do. 

            ____DIETARY CHANGES_____.
              After 3 months following the event i tried to do some diet changes. I cut out milk for a month, tried a gluten free diet, cut out all sugar from my diet, Low fat diet, Low carbohydrate diet, No lactose but nothing helped. I did not even feel the slightest change. I even dropped 10  pounds while i was on Wellbutrin but still no change. MY BMI IS 23

        ___What caused the problem I think______

Now after having spent a lot of time thinking about what could had gone wrong i realized that before my symptoms started i was feeling a bit weak and tired since the past couple months but didn't think much of it. Now i think it had to do with a diet change that I made.
                   I started eating  the normal steel cut oats which i would make overnight and warm them up in the morning and I'm thinking cause of the thick consistency it did something to my stomach since after that i did start having sleep troubles feeling hotter than usual. I ate them everyday  and I never thought it would have had an effect since there healthy to eat. I was eating 2 cups of oats a day and was active going to the gym or on a run 6 days a week. 
                 I did stop eating it but it was a month after the incident but my condition didn't change much at that point. After all the tests and research i have done i think that for some reason there is an increased blood flow to my stomach which is why i feel dizzy and its especially prominent after having a heavy meal. 
                  For example if i eat pizza after some time my heart rate just shoots up and if i am sitting in a chair or standing, I have to sit on the floor and lie down with a fan turned on to calm my body. I have this constant burning sensation in my stomach and my stomach is warm to the touch always. I have been tested for gastroparesis and dumping syndrome and both were negative. 

             _______Condition Now_________

           I don't feel as hungry as i used to and no night sweats, sleep varies day by day  but other than that nothing else has gotten better. Haven't been able to do anything since the past year and half.
           I had graduated and was planning on getting a masters but now I'm living with my parents jobless going from one doctor to another and slowly depleting my savings that I had from working during college. 
            Since my symptoms are similar to pots and sometimes my heart rate does stay above 120bpm which is diagnostic for pots my doctor decided to give the pots medications a try.
                None of the medications have worked but didn't cause me any troubles either until last month. 
                    I tried octreotide acetate which i thought might help and i only took 50mcg which is a starting dose for a total of 4 times and it has made my symptoms worse.I haven't taken the medication for over a month now but the symptoms have not 
subsided and keep getting worse.
                  I start getting tachycardia sometimes while driving, or at a store where my heart rate just shoots up to 130- 140 bpm and i start feeling extremely weak and i have to get out of the store. Before trying the octreotide i was fine i was able to go to the stores easily without a problem but now i cant. 
               I have noticed cold weather helps me since as soon as i go out into the cold the tachycardia goes down I'm guessing its from the vessels getting constricted for that period of time. I have even had times when taking a warm shower caused me tachycardia and i would switch to cold and it would calm down. I am having trouble standing straight now, I feel even more weaker especially in my legs. I have tried compression stockings as well they didn't help. I have also increased my fluid and salt intake but that hasn't helped me either. 
	                  Since octreotide has made my symptoms a lot worse now I was thinking maybe it could be a vasculature problem since it causes splanchnic vasoconstriction. 
               If you have any suggestions please let me know or any tests or procedures I should get done or any other medication I should try. I think there is a high likelihood that something is going on with my stomach but I cant figure out what since i have developed diverticulosis at an age of 26 despite having a good diet and i am a person that doesnt even eat out much. Maybe once in two months. I am thinking about talking to my doctor about having a angiogram of my abdomen and also was thinking of asking my doctor about having a double balloon enteroscopy to look at the full small intestine.

65732,6,Kristopher,male,Caucasian/White,California,United States,1988,October,1988,October,"I believe there is one main symptom that is causing every other issue. It is that there is a fluid in my body that is filling me up from head to toe in a very, very abnormal way. I've only just realized that is what is going on, but for years it has been very slowly getting deposited in me. I can feel it everywhere, most prominently in my head and in my legs. You can see evidence of it visibly under my skin. I can feel it, see it behind my eyes, hear it in my ears. The most distressing symptom is that it is now trapped behind my eyes in the sockets, and it is pounding against the back of my eyes. It is causing persistent floaters and visual disturbances and I find it nearly impossible to use my eyes for any extended period of time. I've seen ophthalmologists and they see no eye-related issues. This fluid is in my joints and my muscles. But I am healthy, and blood work supports that. I do not have liver or kidney issues and no kind of edema, so it doesn't seem to be traditional fluid retention. It seems that the liquid is settling in my muscles, which are more pronounced in some places on my body. All of my systems are working as expected. I do not have unusually concerning pains. I do not have unusual inflammation. My immune system works great and, so far as I can tell, only when it should. There is just some agent of chaos in me that is accumulating over time. It feels less like a condition or disorder and more like a structural abnormality. But it is very difficult to convince medical professionals that that is going on when something as unusual as this is occurring.

I have evidence that this goes back as far as I can remember, but things started to pick up around adulthood. It began with ringing in the ears with no discernible cause, that would get ever so slightly worse over time. Then that evolved into full-blown
sound sensitivity, as, I believe, the fluid continued to build up in head around my ears. Then I began to feel a fluid building up in my legs while I was sitting at work. It would only dissipate when I exerted myself very intensely and physically through running. Then that feeling of fluid building up made its way through my body over time. Then I began to have eye issues. I started to feel a pounding behind my eyes, which was visible when I closed my eyes. Then I began to feel discomfort in my joints. My blood work continued to be the same and normal throughout this entire time, but all symptoms persist and continue to worsen. 

I try to live the cleanest life I possibly can: clean diet, regular exercise, no drinking/drugs/smoking, stress reduction, you name it. But there are no lifestyle changes that can address the root cause. So I tried to rely on the medical community and blood work to identify the problem. But I came to realize that this extra fluid sensation isn't in my blood. It's beyond it in my flesh and muscles, so I'm not sure it will show up in blood work (I've done so many blood tests and nearly everything is totally normal). 


For what it's worth, I have actually seen the fluid myself, so I know I'm not making this up. When I was 15 years old I developed a benign cyst on my back. Ten years later it began to leak some kind of pus, so I tried to squeeze out the rest of the pus. As I did so over the course of a week the cyst swelled up pretty substantially with a red-tinged fluid. I eventually was able to pop that, and when I did a blast of fluid came out of the cyst. It was like a firehose, probably about a full cup's worth. It had the consistency of water, but it had a red tinge to it. In my opinion, that is what the beast is. I have no clue as to what it could be or what its origin is.

I have done my best to identify what might be the source of this, but I truly have no idea. The best clue I have is that it does feel as if the fluid, when it gets deposited, travels initially down my left leg. I can feel a fluid sensation regularly there. Once it was so prominent that it felt like a flood going down my leg. It was not painful at all. I didn't think much of it, thinking it might be some weird kind of sensation, but later in the day I actually did see the fluid through my skin settled in my foot and ankle. It was then around that time that the eye problems got really bad, as I believe that same fluid made its way through my body into my eye sockets, and I could feel the fluid sloshing around behind my eyes (a truly terrible sensation).",Nothing notable.,Nothing notable.,"Dedicated to healthfulness: clean diet, regular exercise, you name it.

Context:

In may 2012, after an evening at the pub i did cocaine like i did once in a while when i was drunk...,but i didn't wore off when i got to bed so i've decided to drink scotch and  smoke a joint of marijuana all by myself to calm me down... All it did was to worsen the situation x1000, i was having trouble seeing, my heartbeat was abnormally low and i felt just a violent rush in my head... I seriously thought i was going to die that night. Weeks passed and everything came back to normal until i did coke again, i felt a strange sensation in my brain (hard to put in words but i felt like a displacement)  and in my hearing (all the noises felt wrong in my brain)... This time it just stuck with me daily. In october 2012, i was prescribed a low dose of antidepressants by doctors who thought these sensations we're just anxiety symptoms. It did feel better, so i went back to my normal lifestyle of social partying (alcohol & sometimes cocaine). But it just didn't do it, the symptoms we're much stronger than before so i've decided to stop everything... Drinking, drugs and the antidepressants.

The next 4-5 months we're literally hell. Unbearable head pressure, Sounds and noises we're almost unbearable (everything was too intense...music,tv... it's like my brain couldn't process it anymore),Unability to sleep ( every time i was on the verge to fall asleep, i passed out for 1 second and my heart would stop and give me a shock through the whole body to wake me back up like an electroshock... this would happen almost every night during this time, sometimes 6-7 times in the same night), i had this buzzing all the time in my ears, i felt on a bad type of adrenaline all day long and i didn't felt rest and calm for months. Overall, i just felt in an extreme state all the time, like a never ending bad trip. However, i never felt ''away'' from reality, my mental and cognitive aptitudes was all there during this time...

I went to see an acupuncturist and told me i had a toxic shock and that i was living on the ''Sympathetic'' nervous system all the time... that my brain couldn't switch to the parasympathetic system anymore like normal people. I saw him for the next 6 months and my situation and my symptoms were a bit better. I did a lot of sports, gym, cut drugs, cut alcohol and cigarettes for a year, and therapeutic respiration and 3 years later i felt i would say 95 to 99% percent back to normal. I was able to reintegrated alcohol (moderately) into my life. I still had insomnia from time to time and felt a bit fuzzy the next day but that was it.

In November 2016, i went on a 2 months trip across the world and in my last place, i was given xanax to improve my sleep in youth hostels. When i came back home, i continued taking Xanax for about a month, 2mg per day paired often with alcohol. On my birthday that month i made a big mistake, i took one line of cocaine (the first time since may 2012)... paired with xanax and alcohol. One day later, it immediately took me where i was 4 years back... in the worst of my situation. This time, it didn't stay extreme for a long time though... symptoms started to wore off 2-3 weeks later.

But today, unfortunately, i'm still stuck with mild to medium symptoms.... Unlike the last time i didn't make a full recovery. My symptoms weren't as extreme as in 2012-2013 but they have stayed pretty constant over the last 3-4 years and i haven't notice much improvements neither. I'm functional, but i feel very handicapped by never feeling normal and ''full'' in my brain. I can't support alcohol anymore, as it always takes me back to square one. I still see a neurologist every 6 months or so and an osteopath for treatments but neither has offered me a clear diagnosis or a clear and concrete plan for a full recovery.

• Gassiness (including constant burping, sometimes over 100 burps per day; correlated with mood – when I get happy or relaxed, I start burping more)
• Bloatedness (particularly in the upper intestines)

• Constipation  (I typically #2 only every three days)

76238,48,Annie,female,Mixed,BC,Canada,2003,February,2017,April,"I am sixteen years old and I live at home with my father. I have an older brother and sister. 

Previous to 3 years ago I was a healthy happy girl playing tennis, volleyball, paddle boarding outside my house and I was competitive in synchronized swimming and came 2nd in BC in my age category. I love school and just finished grade 10, however it was an incredibly challenging year due to my headaches. I have been diagnosed with hypothyroidism that flips between hypothyroid and hyperthyroid, POTS syndrome. However this doesn’t explain my pain. 

I have seen countless doctors and specialists across North America including the team at BC Children’s hospital on several occasions, Massachusetts general hospital and the Stollery Children’s Hospital in Edmonton. I have seen naturopaths, physiotherapists, acupuncturists, and chiropractors. I have had MRI’s and CT scans of my brain, neck and spine that are all unremarkable. We recently investigated the possibility of a CSF leak at Stollery Children’s Hospital in Edmonton. Whilst still a possibility, two blood patch treatments provided no relief. 

However, this does not change the fact that I continue to have severe head pain constantly that prevents me from participating in any normal day-to-day activities. My blood tests also repeatedly show an increased white blood cell count. 

My symptoms started to appear 4 years ago. On more than a few occasions, I found myself falling and fainting for no explainable reason. Subsequently, these falls resulted in multiple concussions which caused mild headaches that did not interfere with my life. I then had another fall in April of 2017 which resulted in torticollis (my neck is tight and stuck to the right).

This past October of 2018 my headaches really progressed. I woke up one morning with my headache significantly worse then usual with no identifiable trigger. From here it escalated every day to the point of unbearable, relentless pain. My dad then had to take me to the emergency room at Children’s Hospital here in Vancouver every 30 hours, as the headaches were constant. Each time I was given propofol, ketorelac and lidocaine for my headaches. This managed  the pain for only a few hours up to 18 hours.

I have had 5 rounds of Botox, and 3 rounds of aimovig. I have tried triptan medications, gabapentin and none of these treatments have made a difference. The only medication that gives me any relief is ketorelac. The headache in nature feels sharp at the top of my head, like its stabbing and pounds on the left side of my head. I can barely sleep at night have developed insomnia despite trying sleeping medication. Prior to this year I was a top student at my school, and continued to pursue good grades despite my headaches all throughout grade 10. But today, the pain is so unbearable that I have to force myself out of the house and into the world to keep a sense of normality in my life. This is by far the most challenging thing I’ve ever had to face.

Over the months my headaches have gotten progressively worse. They range from nine to ten out of ten in severity. They are constant and very debilitating. 

I have tried many pain management strategies such as painting, colouring, drawing, baking, knitting, light walking (when possible) floating in my pool, acupuncture, physio, massage, osteopathy and continue to do these things so but none of this has made a difference. 

My symptoms include:

Severe headache 
Nausea
Loss of appetite
Constipation
Lightheadedness
Neck stiffness and pain
Temperature fluctuations 
Sweating when it’s not hot out 
Weight loss (60lbs)
Fatigue
Lumps in my arms 
Strange rashes
Torticollis

Medications I’m currently taking:

Iron 
Synthroid 
Nortryptalime 
Bissoprolol 
Florinef 
Cyclobenzaprine 
Ketorelac

I am in so much pain and I feel as though there is a physiologic cause for my headaches; we just haven’t figured out that cause yet. I am eager to regain my life and to be able to do the activities I once enjoyed. As of next week, I’m supposed to be going into grade eleven, which I was so exited about. However, I will have to home school a year because of the severity of my headaches. The past year has dragged on for what feels like forever and I don’t want this pain to become my new normal forever. I am only 16 years old and I want my happy pain free life back. I want to go to university, learn to drive and go to law school like my brother or business school like my sister. I would be forever grateful if you could help me do these things by finding the root cause of my headaches.","Diagnosed with POTS and hypothyroidism.

73756,15,Jimmy,male,White,Florida,United States,1991,September,2018,November,"Wake up every morning with a rumbling stomach. The  ""borborygmus"" noise. General Aching comes along with that. The main source of the pain and grumbling is between my rib cages and about three inches above my navel. The grumbling doesn't slow down until I've eaten breakfast. On my good days eating helps get rid of about 90% of the noises and 50% on the pain. I have a constant burnt out feeling in my stomach. Almost as if I drank a glass of battery acid the night prior. That is on a normal day. On a bad day (which I usually get 3x per month) these symptoms are multiplied. The pain becomes a ten. It feels like my stomach was just squeezed by a body builder for 8 hours and has finally been let go. It's a constant sore feeling. This exact pattern has been going on for 2 years. I feel horrible pretty much every day. I am an incredibly active 28 year old. I own 2 businesses, exercise constantly, and drug/alchohol/nicotine/caffeine free. The only time my symptoms completely go away is about 10 minutes into working out. It is a sure-fired solution. Now, that relief is only very temporary. About one hour after the workout is finished, the pain returns. The biggest issue I have been running into is feeling good enough to actually workout.  But once I am there I have temporary relief. If I go 4-5+ hours without eating the symptoms get so incredibly unbearable and painful. I am physically tired and almost beat up/defeated. Some days I have absolutely no fight in me. No specific food makes it worse, no amount of stress changes it. It is a constant pain, and randomly will become debilitating. Also; I have no nausea, no problem eating, no problem pooping, and almost never get heartburn.","Asthma when growing up

3803,23,James,male,Caucasian/White,Massachusetts,United States,1991,September,2017,August,"Probable exposure to chemical hydrazine by inhalation. Symptoms started the next day. Had an attack randomly in middle of work 3 days later nearly passed out. Was pale, sweating, chest pain, difficulty breathing, difficulty thinking straight, exhausted. Symptoms wax and wane but never feel well. Chronic fatigue (at times bone crushing, often exertion related but fatigue is always worse once I stop moving and slow down and try to rest), trouble breathing (difficulty inhaling, shallow breathing, often wake up in night gasping for air), and brain fog (high level cognitive abilities but now barely can remember what I'm doing; feels like someone put an egg beater in my head) are the worst symptoms. Other symptoms include sometimes ringing in ears, mild dizziness (was worse first few weeks after attack), heart rate goes up about 40 bpm upon standing (would jump from 60 to 150 upon standing when I was initially hospitalized, seems like POTS but not officially diagnosed yet. Have this feeling when I lie upside down that all the blood rushing to my head feels like sludge), when I breathe in fully I start coughing. Often when I wake up I feel so out of it that I can't sense where my limbs are and often get this feeling like my arms are broken? (goes away within a minute or so). Been to emergency room many times and seen many doctors and hardly anything found to be wrong. Intolerant to almost everything; can't even drink alcohol anymore because I will feel sick for 2 to 4 days after even having one beer (my father is the same way now as well). Have had weird reactions to medications, for example provigil was supposed to wake me up but it just put me to sleep. Worst reaction was to dexamethasone. Became borderline unresponsive for a week and a half after taking that (vyvanse would pull me out of it for several hours but then I would feel worse than before I took the vyvanse) until a supplement called alpha ketoglutaric acid pulled me out of it, but no further improvement after continuning that medication. Many doctors said I have anxiety or depression but I think they just don't know because I don't feel anxious or depressed and have tried vistaril and zoloft (only for 2 days because side effects were too severe) and neither helped. Been to talk therapy for a couple months as well and symptoms not improved. Father had similar symptoms when he was my age that I did not know about until recently (with the exception of breathing issues) after he took isoniazid for one year. Said nothing really helped and he tried many medications, although biggest improvement he had was from chlorpromazine. His symptoms tapered off over many years but never fully went away. Genetic exome testing was unremarkable. Brain MRI, chest CT, chest xrays, abdominal sonigram, echocardiogram, EEG, lyme test, blood and urine tests (high folate though) all normal. Symptoms at night are the worst, breathing is shallow and difficult (decreased respiratory drive?) and I often wake up feeling more tired than before I went to sleep. Had pulmonologist do lung tests and he said lung strength and capacity and diffusion are all normal (although mild asthma). This year I was diagnosed with alopecia areata, 2 months later psoriasis gutate over my whole body (worst in the scalp), two months later had joint pain that slowly went away except for in my right elbow (could be a cyst?), two months later extreme eye fatigue that was diagnosed as neuropathic corneal pain after seeing inflammation/neuromas through confocal corneal microscopy (did not respond positively to steroid eye drops/serum tears like all other patients), two months later had symptoms of Raynaud's. For the last two months have had difficulty keeping my head up and a choking feeling in my throat (I have to use a neck brace to hold my head up sometimes it's so bad). I think that my breathing problems might be diagnosed as fibromyalgia chest pain (explains the shallow breathing). Last month I tried phototherapy and noticed a big improvement in my stamina (neurologist said my reflexes improved as well), however full body malaise increased as well as some chest pain when breathing. Recently wondering if this is a viral infection of the autonomic ganglia by chicken pox virus (recently read a publication on it) and if it's worth trying anti virals. However, I feel confident that hydrazine was the causal agent in my illness although I haven't been able to prove that yet. Occassional creatine and B6 supplements, proper elevation of the head when sleeping, and avoiding carbs are the biggest improvements in my quality of life. Recently tested for a high IgE level, but this is non specific and could be allergy related.","Very uneventful. Very healthy my whole life. Childhood asthma that was deemed cured after using singular, have some seasonal allergies that have gotten better over time, took vyvanse for a couple years about 5 years ago but stopped, although it helped me focus when I was in school, and some lower back pain but went away when I got a new bed. Some cramping/bloating that I mention I experience later on started in early 2016.","Breast cancer on mother's side of family, father had a blood clot about 10 years ago, mother has low b12/iron that she supplements for, Dad had similar illness as me when he was my age.","Not athletic (slim) but enjoyed physical activities. Worked long hours but usually enjoyed work. Social life diminished lately due to focus on work. Taking time off due to illness but not improving, may have to leave job.",Ultrasound showed some sludge in the gallbladder. Echocardiogram showed slightly enlarged heart valve that cardiologist deemed normal.,Worst thing that has happened to me. Feel completely isolated as a result. Unable to participate in normal activities and great deal of trouble focusing. Scared to go to sleep every night because I feel that I might stop breathing or breathing is so bad it may cause brain damage.

66577,15,Bea,female,Northern European,Minnesota,United States,1985,February,2011,January,"Numerous neurologic manifestations beginning in 2012 including: severe muscle weakness, loss of sensation in extremities, memory loss, hypersomnolence, and multiple symptoms of autonomic dysregulation. An initial diagnosis of seronegative Myasthenia gravis was made, followed by Autonomic and Sensory Neuropathy and Hashimoto's Encephalitis. At this time paraneoplastic antibodies, N-type Calcium Channel Ab and GAD65, were identified along with Thyroperoxidase Abs. In the following year, Adrenal Insufficiency and Hypothyroidism were diagnosed. A cancer screen in 2013, showed an elevated Chromogranin A, but further testing was not pursued. In 2014, the patient began experiencing intense wrenching and searing focal pain in the lower abdomen/pelvis. Episodes of facial flushing, rapid heart rate, shortness of breath, and nocturnal diarrhea followed. These episodes became more intense and frequent over time. Repeat testing revealed a 3-fold increase in Chromogranin A and an elevated 5-HIAA. Years later, the patient developed an elevated CEA and Tumor Necrosis Factor as well. During this time existing autoimmunity worsened and the patient also developed additional elevated antibody titers, including: Acetylcholine Recptor Ab, ANA, and anti-SSA (Ro) and experienced multiple signs and symptoms of systemic autoimmunity that continue to date. Between 2014 and 2017 MRI and additional imaging showed a stationary cyst on the left ovary. During this time the patient began experiencing regular and eventually constant fevers ranging between 100-104F and iron deficient anemia. A diagnosis of Carcinoid Syndrome was made in late 2017 and the patient was started on Octreotide. Repeat testings after four months on Octreotide showed a significant decline in Chromogranin A and 5-HIAA values. In 2018, a bi-lateral salpingo-oophorectomy and hysterectomy was performed, after which treatment with Octreotide was suspended. Minimal pathology was done; gross inspection and only two slices from an indeterminate area of the left ovary were taken. No specialized staining for Carcinoid was performed, despite physician request. After surgery and for the five months following the episodes of facial flushing, rapid heart rate, shortness of breath, and nocturnal diarrhea were absent, the pain was significantly alleviated, the fevers vanished, the anemia resolved, and overall autoimmune disease burden significantly was decreased. However, at the end of the fifth month, the aforementioned symptoms all returned and testing once again showed an elevation in Chromogranin A and 5-HIAA. In February 2019, the patient was hospitalized for life-threatening anemia, with a hemoglobin of 6.4g/dL and a ferritin of 1 microgram/L. Endoscopy, colonoscopy, and a pill-cam study were performed, all of which were unremarkable. To date no cause for the anemia has been identified and the patient requires regular IV iron infusion and still struggles to achieve hemoglobin and ferritin values in appropriate range. In the summer of 2019, the patient was diagnosed with increased intracranial pressure and papilledema, which has been found to increase in severity when hemoglobin is low.",No significant history.,Only biological brother is healthy and without significant medical history. Mother is also in good health. Father is treated for high blood pressure and cholesterol. Paternal Aunt has lupus. A number of  Father's cousins (patient's second cousins) have Celiac Disease.,Patient was a graduate student who enjoyed an active lifestyle and enjoyed travel. Patient rarely drank and never smoked.,"In 2011, a sleep study including a multiple sleep latency test (MSLT) was performed. The sleep study showed multiple abbreviated REM cycles throughout the night. No apnea was observed. In the MSLT sleep was obtained in 4 out of 5 - 20 minute naps with a mean sleep latency of 7.9 minutes. REM sleep was observed in 3 naps. From this testing, a diagnosis of Narcolepsy was given, assuming muscle weakness to be cataplexy. This diagnosis was discarded in 2012 when diagnosed with the aforementioned diagnoses.

Testing in 2012: Quantitative Sensory Testing indicated significantly decreased hot and cold sensory thresholds. Small fiber nerve biopsy showed decreased nerve density in extremities. Tilt table exam showed orthostatic instability. Muscle biopsy showed, ""scattered atrophic fibers that were polygonal in appearance. On ATPase staining these fibers showed themselves to be predominantly, if not exclusively, type 2b."" Single fiber EMG was suggestive of neuromuscular transmission abnormality. Initial CSF study showed mild pleocytosis. B12 and malonic acid levels where in normal range. Antibody testing revealed elevated Paraneoplastic antibodies, N-type Calcium Channel and GAD65, as well as elevated Thyroperoxidase antibodies that remain elevated to date. Sedimentation rates and C-Reactive protein have been significantly elevated throughout disease. The patient also often has low albumin levels.
In years following, additional elevated titers of the Acetylcholine Receptor Antibody, ANA, and anti-SSA (Ro) were found. 

Low ACTH, Cortisol, and DHEA-Sulfate led to diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency. Seronegative to 21-Hydroxylase Antibody. Elevated TSH led to treatment of hypothyroidism and subsequent elevations in Synthroid dose.

Porphyrin testing was done and found negative.

The patient had an episode of pancreatitis with elevated pancreatic lipase levels. 

Consistent elevations of Chromogranin A and 5-HIAA and as disease progressed elevated CEA and Tumor necrosis factor.

MRI and ultrasound of the lower abdomen and pelvis between 2014-2017 showed a stationary cyst on the left ovary. One radiology report mentions a rim-enhancing structure in the left adnexa. During this period, patient had an elevated WBC count, neutrophilia, and at times elevated platelets along with consistent fever. 

MRI of the brain as recently as 2019 displays radiologic features indicating increased intracranial pressure and papilledema.

The patient has consistently low hemoglobin, ferritin and other lab results indicative of iron deficient anemia when tested. Multiple Endoscopies and colonoscopies as well as a pill-cam study were unremarkable.","It has rendered the patient completely disabled. She was forced to take a leave of absence from graduate school in late 2011, and has been unable to attend school or work since. She struggles with the most basic tasks of self care and requires regular assistance from her Mother, who is her care provider. Extremely reduced mobility due to muscle weakness, debilitating pain, lack of stamina and energy, and regular dizzy spells keep her isolated and a prisoner in her home. This disease took away a promising future and left a limited and painful existence.","The patient's neurologist, who is a neuro-muscular junction specialist, communicated that in his over 35 years of practice he had never encountered someone he could not authoritatively diagnose, until her. He has conferred with other physicians at his practice as well as experts at conferences and searched literature extensively without finding a case that resembles the patient's presentation. Despite this, her neurologist believes in a unifying diagnosis. 
The patient has similarly searched medical literature and publications with the same result. As suggested in literature regarding autoimmune paraneoplastic syndromes, there are presentations yet to be identified. The patient believes that it is likely and knows that there are diagnostic  and research tools available that could characterize this disease and potentially lead to her having a much improved quality of life if she can just be connected with the right physicians and scientists.",Whole body,Unidentified Paraneoplastic

82833,12,Morris,male,Caucasian/White,California,United States,1994,April,2016,June,"I have the feeling of being short of breath for 4 years now.  I've never, however, actually had a low oxygen reading.   

I feel like I am always sighing/gasping/yawning/ and mouth breathing in order to get a satisfying breath.  Sometimes the satisfying breath will not come for minutes at a time.  

During waking hours, I never have a moment free from this breath awareness and usually feel like a breath is incomplete multiple breaths per minute.

For the first few years, the shortness of breath was accompanied by burping.  I went to a gastro who put me on a course of omeprazole.  The burping issue went away and the shortness of breath improved slightly.

High levels of physical activity also seems to result in shortness of breath later in the evening.  I'm usually normal (only slightly short of breath) during the run, but later that night when I lay down for bed I have difficulties getting a satisfying breath and thus with sleep onset.

Finally, I sometimes notice that my right nostril is blocked.  Though I experience shortness of breath even when my sinuses seem clear, my right side does feel backed up during the periods where shortness of breath feels most intense.","Very healthy, no issues.","Kidney Cancer, heart disease","Vegan, distance marathon runner","Cardio

10904,19,Jennell,female,Caucasian/White,California,United States,1981,January,2014,January,"The pain is in the center of my upper abdomen, right below my breasts and goes through to my back and sometimes to my shoulders, neck, and jaw. 

Deep ache that comes on suddenly and lasts anywhere from 5 minutes to several hours. The pain rates at around 8-10 on the pain scale.

Nothing I do makes the pain better. I just have to ride it out and let it subside on its own.

Happens intermittently; both while awake and while asleep. For months at a time, it will happen several times a week. Then I have a month or so with no pain.

Eating or drinking does not bring it on nor does it make it better.

While awake I have noticed that it happens a lot after my stomach growls.

The two worst attacks happened the morning after taking Nyquil the previous night at bedtime.

It sometimes feels like I have something wrapped around my abdomen that is squeezing so hard that it hurts to breathe. The pain lasts several hours when this happens.

I have numerous bouts of nausea every day, but no vomiting.

I also have pain and pressure in the right upper quadrant where my gallbladder was. It feels like I have a fist just pressed into my side all the time. Sometimes it's so bad that I can't sleep or get comfortable.

I am tired all the time, even after 8-10 hours of sleep. I never feel rested. I wake up often throughout the night.

My body aches and I feel like I have the flu most days.

My feet and ankles swell mildly at night.

My lower legs itch like crazy with no skin changes to account for it.

I get headaches that last all day about 2-3 days a week. They are centered behind my eyes and it feels like my eyes are going to explode out of my head. The pain is relieved somewhat by pressing on my eyes.

My body is very sensitive to touch and at times just my clothes rubbing on me is very irritating.

Lightly pressing or rubbing on my back is very painful, especially my lower back.

I often have palpitations, even when just sitting.

I often have whole body pain and joint pain with no discernible cause.

My eyesight has gotten worse in the last couple of years and my eyes hurt sometimes. I have had a couple of tear duct infections and numerous small styes.

I have lost some hearing in my right ear. It sounds like people have robot voices when I try to use the phone on that ear. It is hard for me to figure out what direction noises are coming from around me. Background noise irritates me and gets in the way of me hearing what people are saying more than it used to. I also have a constant high pitched ringing in that ear along with a whooshing noise. These vary in severity, but they never go completely away.

I have periods of mental fogginess where I forget/struggle to find the words I am trying to say in the middle of a conversation. I have a pretty good memory otherwise, I just can't remember words when I am talking. Its gotten bad enough that other people have noticed without me telling them.

My tongue, toes, and feet go numb periodically.

My arms and hands tingle and the tingling will last for hours.

I've been having some difficulty swallowing and small pieces of food or pills will get stuck in my throat.

My fingernails are weak and always break in the nail bed if I let them grow out even a little bit.

My feet/legs sometimes give out on me when walking. I just severely sprained my ankle in December because my foot buckled on me while walking.

I sometimes lose strength in my hands where I can't even turn the lid on a water bottle that was previously opened or have dropped things I was holding. This only lasts for about an hour or so. 

Scaly, itchy, burning rash that lasts for 6 months to a year. The first time I got it was in 2010 and it was on my back and inner thighs; lasted 6 months. The second time was in 2014 and it was the entire torso; lasted 12 months. The third time was in 2016 and was just a few random spots; it lasted 7 months. The fourth time was in 2019 and was a few random spots; has lasted over 6 months. Derm did a biopsy on one lone spot after outbreak healed and it came back as lichenoid dermatitis, possibly caused by taking NSAIDs (all I took was tylenol and excedrin).","Surgeries/Hospitalizations:

*In hospital twice for a week or longer for severe gastroenteritis of undetermined cause with extremely high fevers - 1981 & 1982
*C-Section - 2000
*C-Section - 2003
*Gallbladder removed due to gallbladder disease (functioning at 26%); upper hernia repair (due to pregnancies); tummy tuck - 2005
*C-Section - 2013
*Endoscopy - 2015
*Endoscopy - 2016
*Endoscopy - 2018

No formal diagnosis for abdominal pain; ""best guess"" diagnosis of dysfunctional dyspepsia.

Diagnosis of lichenoid dermatitis for skin rashes; believed to be caused by taking NSAIDs.","Maternal grandmother died of liver/urinary tract/ovarian cancer (3 separate cancers)
Maternal grandfather died from a blood clot following surgery to place a stent in the heart. He also had Type 2 diabetes.
Paternal grandmother died of lung cancer.
Paternal grandfather had chronic emphysema/COPD.
Maternal aunt had bypass surgery for blocked arteries; suffered a stroke after surgery; also has Crohn's disease, Celiac intolerance, and Type 2 diabetes.
Father has had 2 heart attacks with unknown cause; no blockage of arteries. History of very low blood pressure. He has had his gallbladder removed due to stones.
Mother died while in recovery after open-heart surgery for three 50% blocked arteries; her heart tissue was extremely friable. She had had two mild heart attacks a few days before surgery. She had Type 2 diabetes and interstitial cystitis.
Sister has hypothyroidism - She is my half-sister. We share a dad.
One brother had gallbladder removed due to stones.
My other brother is autistic with mental retardation. Has had several fatty tumors removed from back and chest.  He is my half-brother. We share a dad.","I only eat one or two small meals a day due to nausea or just not being hungry.
I don't exercise as much as I should due to working, running a business and taking care of kids. I plan on starting a daily walk once the weather warms up some.
I'm a daily smoker; anywhere from 2-8 cigarettes a day, somedays I don't have any. I am working on reducing the amount in order to eventually quit.
I drink water regularly throughout the day; average about 50 ounces a day.
I rarely drink alcoholic beverages; average 1-2 drinks a month.
No recreational drug use. No history of drug use.","Numerous x-rays, CT scans (with and w/o contrast), ultrasounds and endoscopies have been done: 
One X-ray showed part of my pancreas was slightly enlarged but no other tests corroborated this. 
One CT scan showed the lining of my stomach was thickened. 
One ultrasound showed cortical thinning in both of my kidneys.
Imaging tests for Sphincter of Oddi disorder and common bile duct disorders were unremarkable.
Heart stress echo, ECG and Echo Doppler were within normal limits.
Multiple blood tests with no significant findings other than one that showed elevated liver enzymes. Creatinine levels are always low.  
X-ray of my lower back showed a sacralized transitional vertebral body.
The rheumatoid factor blood test was negative.
H. Pylori test was negative.
Hepatitis tests were negative.
TSH levels are normal.
Blood sugar levels are within normal limits.
Bilirubin levels have been normal.
Two gastric emptying studies were normal.","I have always felt tired and ""under the weather."" As a child I always wanted to sleep. I would choose sleeping over playing or going outside anyday! The symptoms described in my case file either started new or began to get worse in 2013, during my last pregnancy. It is frustrating to wake up every day and not feel good. I have a very busy life and I struggle sometimes because I just don't have the energy and just want to stay in bed. My husband and kids don't understand how I am ""sick"" so much so I find myself trying to hide the fact that I feel bad more often than not.  I am tired of feeling so ""sick and tired.""

26135,9,Teri,female,Caucasian/White,Tennessee,United States,1968,October,2020,February,"Moderate to severe pain in joints, bones, and muscles of hands and feet, including fingers and toes. 
On top of this, carpal tunnel syndrome (tingling and pain in both hands) and plantar fasciitis (heel pain, both feet). 
Tingling/extreme sensitivity in toe tips.
Chronic fatigue. 
Involuntary toe movement, both feet.
Pain in ankles (primarily right ankle), and right hip.
Urinary urgency.
Sensitivity to hot weather: fatigue is worse, fingers swell and turn white from middle knuckle to fingertip. 

--I'm not sure which of these symptoms are connected and which are separate.","This may or may not be related: in 1990, my mother, sister and I all had a bad flu. Afterwards, we were all diagnosed with Chronic Fatigue Syndrome because of fatigue, stomach pain, and rash/allergies. About 8 years later, a doctor decided I had just gained a bunch of separate new conditions around the same time:
allergies caused the fatigue 
acid reflux caused the stomach pain
Rosacea caused redness on my face

I had been very athletic up to that point, but afterwards I found myself getting winded by short walks. Very gradually I got a little better and began playing sports like tennis, but always had to rest afterwards (this was around 2000). This level of activity and fatigue continued, with some ebbs and flows, to spring 2020.

Also over these years, it took stronger and stronger meds to control my acid reflux. And I gradually gained weight, from a healthy 150 pounds or so in 1990 to 215 pounds in 2020.

In spring 2016, I went off my anti-depressant, thinking I didn't need it anymore. Almost immediately, my hands and feet ached, and my acid reflux was much worse. After a month or so, I went to my doctor, who diagnosed it as withdrawal from the anti-depressant (I'd been on one for 8 years at that point). Pain went away and acid reflux was much improved when I went back on an anti-depressant.

Diagnosed with sleep apnea in fall 2019. CPAP machine used daily since October 2019. 

The hands and feet began to hurt--mildly--at least as early as spring 2019. I assumed it was basic arthritis, and was busy dealing my sister's terminal cancer. She died in December 2019. The pain in my hands and feet was up to moderate by February 2020, so I finally went to the doctor about it. My doctor diagnosed medication-induced lupus, and we tried taking me off Dexilant, then Abilify. The pain continued to get more intense, as did the fatigue.

Summer 2020 my toes started moving on their own, and restless legs at bedtime became intense. Both primary care doc and neurologist think it could be withdrawal from Abilify, and neurologist also thinks perhaps just ""Moving Toes Syndrome."" Rheumatologist did many blood tests and x-rays: no joint swelling on x-rays, and the only blood test that was abnormal was the ANA (positive homogenous 1:640). 

Neurologist did a brain MRI and found lesions in the white matter, but said they were ""not new."" 

Primary care doctor put me on Plaquenil in June 2020. Didn't seem to be doing anything, so rheumatologist told me to go off in September, to see if anything happened or it changed the blood tests. What happened was that my fingertips and toe-tips started tingling, and my hands got numb. After a month I went back on Plaquenil, but with no change. Primary care doctor diagnosed carpal tunnel syndrome in November 2020. Just went off Plaquenil again, 12/10/20, with no changes.

--Oh, and I've had chronic low back pain since 1999, probably due to breaking my tailbone in 1980. In 1999, an MRI of my low back showed a bulging disc. Chiropractic care, on and off over the years, helps.","Father had Parkinson's and fronto-temporal lobe dementia before his death from a fall and head injury. Mother died of pancreatic cancer. Sister died of lung cancer, but she also had unspecified cancer attached to the intestines. Mother had Hashimoto's, but my thyroid tests normal. Depression in both parents. Hypertension in one grandparent on my mother's side.","The only exercise I like is walking, so occasional walks with dogs and occasional trips to the gym for 30 minute elliptical sessions for the 5 years prior to December 2019. New puppy retriever required daily walks in December 2020, but I fell and hurt my knee (the orthopedist said I nearly broke my kneecap) at the end of December 2020, so I took about 6 weeks off from daily walks. Back to daily dog walks (45-60 minutes) in February 2020 and to this day, though the walks are fairly slow most days since the fatigue got worse in summer 2020.

I eat too many sweets. Work online part-time; spouse makes the household's living money. Before 2015, I taught full-time at various colleges and universities for 20+ years.","Physician's assistant, primary care doctor, rheumatologist, and neurologist have done numerous blood tests. Thyroid normal, B12 normal, vitamin D slightly low, iron slightly low, blood glucose slightly high but not quite diabetic, specific tests for inflammation and auto-immune normal, except the ANA (positive homogenous 1:640). No joint swelling on x-rays of hands and feet. 

Brain MRI done by neurologist shows some lesions in white matter, ""not new"" and looking like, the doctor said, lesions they sometimes see with people who have migraines (I've never had one) or high blood pressure (I've had some, but not high enough for primary care doctor to treat). Quote from neurologist's notes: ""Abnormal MRI scan of the brain showing bilateral white matter disease of nonspecific etiology, but demyelination and chronic microvascular disease are in the differential diagnosis."" 

Neurologist scheduled another brain MRI and neck MRI for March 2021. Rheumatologist has provided no guesses about diagnosis.","The hand and foot pain is the worst part, because the foot pain affects walking and the hand pain affects typing and many other activities. My biggest concern is that I'm told it often takes 3 or more years to diagnose complex syndromes (autoimmune, connective tissue diseases, MS, fibromyalgia) and yet every site also says, ""Early treatment is key to preventing worse symptoms and early death."" Without a diagnosis, doctors can't know what to try for treatment.",Primary care physician originally thought drug-induced lupus.

19286,23,David,male,Caucasian/White,California,United States,1996,June,2019,September,"Previously a high functioning college graduate for a top school, David, 23 years old, became less engaged over 9 months - less ambition, stopped an engineering internship, less curiosity, less interest in life, lost friends.  Felt like depression to those close to him, and he articulated feeling depressed a few times.  Near the end of 9 months, was only interested in eating, video games, and smoking (previously very healthy).

The ""1st psychotic break"" occurred when he started throwing pebbles at bedroom window in middle of night and could not explain why.  He was admitted to a rural psychiatric hospital where he refused care, and after a couple of days, refused to eat.  With court order, he received Ativan, Haldol and then Geodone, and then mainly Zyprexa for a month (all by injection).  Due to the inability of the rural hospital to maintain food / fluids, he was released in an apparently unimproved state after about 1 month.  The diagnosis at this point was Schizophreniform.  At home, he ate a few meals, but then started smoking and not eating.  He then hurt himself with a knife after just 3-4 days at home.  

He then went to Hospital #2.  He still refused to eat or drink or take medications.  His standard explanation is ""I'll eat when I get out.""    His nutrition and fluid status was maintained with an NG tube and IV fluids.  He became increasingly catatonic.  Medicines included Zyprexa and Risperdal, along with Depacote and Ativan.  His weight went from 160 to about 130 lbs (6 foot, 2 in).  

After about 1 month in hospital 2, He was then transferred to hospital 3 due to the seriousness of the case.  A PEG tube was inserted for nutrition.  At some point, a diagnosis was added - catatonia.  The drugs were stopped and ECT was started.  After 7 sessions of ECT (at 3 per week), he started eating.  He gradually recovered and seemed more normal - but still a ""little off"".  But definitely better.  He was discharged with outpatient ECT once per week.  At this point, the Drs. said it could be major depressive disorder with psychosis, but the Drs. were not ruling out schizophrenia.  His recovery took about 2 months in hospital 3.  

After a month on the outside in a group home, he started acting more erratically and broke a TV set in the home.  He was re-admitted to hospital 3 and the same cycle started - not eating or drinking and refusing all medication (and reliance on court orders for care).  He subsequently deteriorated and was put on NG Tube and then PEG tube.  He had seven sessions of ECT and then started eating (just like last time).  But after only 1-2 days, he stopped eating again.  He became increasingly resistant - pulling out the NG tube and/or the PEG tube.  He was given a 24 hour sitter and restraints increased.  Due to refusals of medication, and low muscle mass, he did not receive any significant trials of drugs this time - short stint of Abilify - and also Ativan.  He also had 3 doses of Ketamine - he seemed to not mind the Ketamine, but did not cure delusions about food/ eating.  Along the way, he acquired a blood borne infection that was treated with antibiotics for a month and cured.

He has been in hospital 3 for 3.5 months (this stay after readmission).  Current state is around 130 lbs, getting fluids through IV, getting nutrition through NG tube, and now getting Clozaril through NG tube.  His state varies from seeming to understand and be able to comment (but very slow forming sentence), to more catatonic lately.  He has not been willing to express many thoughts about how he is feeling, how the medications effect him, etc.  This has been very frustrating.  He is controlled with restraints because he pulls out the NG tube and IVs. 

The major complication has been his resistance - unwillingness to eat or drink or take medications and willingness to pull out NG tube / IVs  This limits the options of Drs. to drugs that can go through NG tube or IV - they don't feel intramuscular shots are a great option (and they did not work at Hospital 1). Another major barrier has been his lack of communication.  He will communicate on everyday topics, but as soon as you bring up matters related to his health or eating, he either shuts down and goes silent, can't respond to logic, or repeats an explanation such as ""I made a promise not to eat"".  There have been other, way less frequent, delusional explanations like ""I'll save the children"".  Even if he is responding to everyday conversation, it can take him 10-45 seconds to complete a thought (starts sentence, then can't come up with words).   The two major treatment options at this point seem to be Clozaril (for psychosis/delusions) and ECT (for catatonia).  ECT is complicated by the presence of the NG tube, and a PEG risks more serious consequences if pulled out.  Drs. are working out a way to do ECT with NG tube in.  The Clozaril is being titrated up.  It has been a very difficult case.  He is increasingly catatonic.  

Look for input on any other possible treatments for catatonia and psychosis.  Also looking for any ideas on how to get him to eat.   Open to more ""outside the box"" ideas.  I respect science, but this case seems to be an extreme outlier event, and he has deteriorated under the standard medical and psychiatric protocols.  So I'm open to other ideas that may have more limited evidence (but at least some grounding in logic or theory).  This has been a heartbreaking case to see a kind, high performing student, athlete, and musician deteriorate to someone in a hospital bed barely able to form words.  Thank you for any input you can give - it is greatly appreciated!",Very healthy.  Excellent athlete.

97657,10,Angie,female,Caucasian/White,Massachusetts,United States,1985,March,2016,May,"-Daily nausea, reflux, belching since 2016, plus stomach pain (stomach pain is not always daily)

-Had upper stomach issues ""ibs"" that was stable and manageable since 2005. It started about 1 month after returning from a semester abroad in Kenya/Tanzania and a barium x-ray in 2006 was unremarkable

-Weakness, fatigue, inability to exercise  

-Always thirsty and fairly frequent urination 

-Endoscopy showed esophagitis/gastritis 

-Daily headaches since December 2020, especially in the morning and before meals 
--unintentionally lost 15 lbs between ~2013-2016 and struggled with weight loss until spring 2020 when a doctor advised me to make myself eat more in the hopes that more calories would improve my health. I still eat more than I have an appetite for to mitigate headaches and hunger at night. 

-Intermittent gland pain/aching since 2016 (in the past have had periods of shooting pain when I yawn that could last a week or two). No major swelling in last year or so, just aching  

-Some intermittent pain in upper right abdominal area (Used to have diffuse pain all across that area, could not lay on right side for more than a couple minutes). Now I have twinges every now and then (sometimes when I'm walking or if I twist or slouch). 

-Eating meat often causes bloating in stomach and upper right abdomen, in the past this has lasted for a couple days along with worsened acid reflux and heart burn

-Intermittent joint pain, especially when undercaloried due to stomach pain/nausea 

-Intermittent mid-lower back pain","All the things that I include here couldn't possibly be relevant but I mention them in the off chance that they are important! Thank you for reading. 

Prior to nausea and other symptoms (starting in 2016) I had some upper stomach issues that started 1-2 months after returning from a college semester abroad in Kenya/Tanzania. Stomach issues became manageable through diet (gluten free, avoided milk, limited fruit) and I was otherwise able to have a normal, active lifestyle. I would only occasionally have stomach pain and need to rest in the evenings. 

My first repeated stomach illness was food poisoning in high school after taking antibiotics and for the next couple years, once a year, I would get bad diarrhea, vomiting, and felt like I would pass out. Then, in East Africa (sophomore semester in college) I had ""travel sickness"" and a fever and was treated with Cipro which resolved the issues. In high school and early college the food poisoning episodes did not result in any noticeable chronic issues.

As a young kid I had more frequent urination than other kids. In my early twenties my primary care tested me for diabetes type II due to a couple symptoms but the results were negative. I was not familiar with or concerned about diabetes at the time. 

Also: 
-Anemia in high school, no known anemia since then 
-In 2016 had elevated iron levels (was 224 H, Reference Range: 40-190 mcg/dL, in attached doc). To reduce my iron levels I had my hormonal IUD removed - heavier periods may have helped reduce it or it was a coincidence.
-Otherwise, iron levels have been normal, and recently on the low side of normal (despite taking a multivitamin with 100% RDA of iron). 

My mother said when I was 2-3 years old I had worms visible in my stool, which went away on their own after a while. When I was a kid I lived in a small town in the country and it wasn't typical for my family to go to the doctor unless it was an emergency.
We lived in the country until I was 14 and I grew up with goats (drinking raw milk), horses, dogs, cats. We mostly ate organic foods, whole grains and a lot of home grown vegetables. I again had very close exposure to goats in East Africa (slept on a floor at a homestay with goats in a Maasai dung hut. The hut was made from cow dung. We also used portable solar showers that were filled with local, untreated river water. (I mention all of this since environmental exposure in my case may be part of the problem.)

Also, when my husband and I lived in New Mexico for a few years (2013-16) we bought a dog, an Aussie mix, from a goat farm. While this is most certainly irrelevant, she also had nausea and reflux for several years (diagnosed by our vet, not by me), probably a coincidence given common symptoms. She also has had repeat injuries (despite keeping her exercise light), C diff, and recently some nerve issues.

When I was a kid I got sick (fever I remember, I can't recall what else) and had painless bumps under the skin on my head/scalp about 1-2 cm in diameter, some round and some irregular in shape. Except one, they all went away over a long period. One is still behind my left ear but much flatter than it was as a kid. It feels like hard muscle on top of the bone. It has never caused any problems that I know of, but I mention having been sick because and I know some conditions can relapse or cause other issues and I never heard of the other kids having it.","Father: 
-Starting in early twenties he recurring blood clots and serious ulcerative colitis (lost all of his hair). He died of colon cancer at age 48. 
-In case it's worth mentioning, his grandfather said he was alway thirsty as a child. 


Maternal Grandparent: 
-had a heart attack in her thirties
-arthritis 


Mother: 
-Arthritis
-Had an angina in her early thirties a second heart issue in her mid forties. She still has heart aching/pressure on occasion. Otherwise she is fairly healthy for her age. 
-A genetic test also showed that she could be at risk for blood sugar issues

Sister: 
-Had high iron levels, anxiety, and some diarrhea (I will follow up to see if she has had iron levels tested recently)","Prior to 2016, I was generally healthy, working, and regularly active. I competed in ballroom dancing (practiced several evenings per week) and enjoyed volleyball, frisbee, and hiking. I was careful with my diet to avoid stomach pain (gluten free and ate organic, regular meals).  

However, when I lived in New Mexico I had some gradual decline. I was a little less active and would occasionally have to cancel social activities due to not feeling well. Generally I was active and OK though.","I have seen around eight doctors, pursuing three specialties: GI, infectious disease, and endocrinology. (I was referred to Rheumatology and didn't have any obvious diagnosis, normal ANA.)

I have tried a couple antacids and PPIs and they always make my symptoms worse. Nausea becomes intolerable. 

I try to manage stomach pain with a limited diet, also light on fiber, but it is unreliable (FODMAP was not useful either)


2020-21: 

-Had two blood tests for parasites: strongyloidiasis and schistosomiasis. The former was negative. Results showed a ""weak positive"" result for African and Asian (japonicum) schistosomiasis. It was unclear whether I had an active infection. I was treated anyway with ~600mg of praziquantil December 2020 and again in January.

I was also treated for cryptosporidium Nov 2020 (was positive through stool test) BUT they didn't find the antigen. This seemed odd to my doctor, but she decided to treat anyway. My stomach issues did not abate so I am wondering if the test wasn't accurate. Although it's also possible I picked it up the few times I went to local swimming holes, Hopkinton Lake and Arlington Reservoir). I never had diarrhea though. 


2018 CT: 
-Showed increased thickening of duodenum, ""mild bilateral fulness of pelvicalyceal system"", uterine fibroids, thickening of bladder wall  


Endoscopy 2016: 
-esophagitis / gastritis 
-abnormal Z line 
-confirmed negative h pylori 

Colonoscopy 2016: 
-some ischemia, etc. (attached)

July 2016 - treated with quadruple therapy for h pylori

For what it's worth, the only herb or prescription that ever made any major improvement to my health is Barberry powder. The issue was that when I stopped taking it, my symptoms returned quite quickly. And when I tried to take it a second time it caused a lot of stomach pain because it is so concentrated.","This past year has been the most difficult, since even short walks on good days are almost always hard. Mostly, whatever I have has been deeply confusing, because I have always been active and health conscious. I have also tried many diets (even vitamins and herbs) and done other things to make sure lifestyle is not any major contributor (like reduced stress, deep breathing, rest when needed, etc.). I am now seeing multiple specialists to try to find an answer.","I have had exposure to unclean water when traveling and swam in places domestically a hand full of times that were common swimming places but not very clean (local lakes/ponds). As mentioned, I have also had exposure to livestock, environments where rodents were discovered, and I have had some raw milk over the years (strictly dairy free now). 
I have also travelled a lot and I believe the onset of my symptoms after two trips in particular is probably not coincidental, but maybe it is -- I just want to find a diagnosis/treatment! Thank you for your help.


Additional Notes: 

I have an endoscopy test June 2021. Any suggestions for biopsy tests (that they may not be testing for anyway) are very much appreciated! 

Any ideas about cause of thirst and systemic issues related to it are welcome! 

I plan to get a stomach emptying test soon.

Please note:
I plan to ask to be tested for the following things, even if just to rule them out:  
-Echinococcosis 
-Fascioliasis
-Visceral leishmaniasis 
-Brucellosis
-Whipple's disease

If you strongly support any of these tests it would be nice to know as well!

92447,9,Reed,male,Caucasian/White,Canterbury,New Zealand,1988,July,2014,May,"Brief Case Summary:

May 2014 - I sneezed, felt a pop and heard a crack in my lower right abdomen. I experienced tightness and pressure in my abdomen and a sharp pain around my 10th right rib. Initial X-Rays, CT, MRIs showed no anatomic abnormality. The abdominal wall muscles around my R10th rib became weaker over the following months, and felt like they were being gradually pulled inward. I developed a noticeable asymmetry in my abdominal wall along with a palpation or “popping” that could be felt over the costal margin of my 10th rib whenever I tensed my abdomen.

May 2015 - A general surgeon diagnosed me with an abdominal wall hernia after feeling this palpation. He operated and found nothing (much to his surprise).

June 2015 - I had a dynamic ultrasound which showed a separated R10th rib, and “herniation” of the layers of abdominal wall musculature inward, snapping over the costal margin.

May 2016 - Surgery to excise the costal cartilage of the 10th rib (open incision). This resulted in a marginal amount of relief in regards to the pressure and lack of distention and flexion in my abdominal wall.

August 2016 - I coughed and felt a pop in my lower left abdomen. I later found out my left 10th rib had broken off at the costal margin in exactly the same way as my R10th rib.

November 2016 - Surgery to resect my L10th rib and resect more of the R10th rib (open incision). This again resulted in a small amount of relief in regards to the pressure and tightness.

July 2018 - Diagnosed with bilateral rib impingement.  Had a bilateral 10th rib (performed laparoscopically). My L11th rib was mistakenly also removed.

June 2019 - I underwent abdominal wall reconstructive surgery to attempt to release the abdominal wall muscles. Biological mesh was inserted to provide support to the chest wall. I still have abdominal pressure, lightheadedness, inability to put on weight (I remain 20kg+ under my previous weight) or build strength in my abdomen. I am incredibly weak physically, and have very little movement in my abdominal wall. Though no medical imaging outside of my dynamic ultrasounds from 2015-2016 demonstrate this, it feels like the musculature that was pulled so far inward compressing the abdominal cavity is still fixed in the same contracted position.

I have a long and complex case, so I highly recommend you read through the attached pdf explaining my case history. I am looking for a diagnosis and solution, but am especially interested in hearing from anyone who can make sense of my dynamic chest wall ultrasound imaging (attached in DICOM format).",Very healthy. No major illnesses prior to this.,"I have a younger sister who is healthy, and both my parents are in their mid-60s with no disease.","Extremely active gymnast and weight lifter. I previously did strength training 4x a week, and hiked regularly.","Yes. I detail these in the PDF of my case history, but all of the tests over the years have shown no abnormality EXCEPT for a series of chest wall ultrasounds I had in 2015 and 2016. I have attached this imaging and others in DICOM format below.","It’s hard to overstate just how debilitating this has been, and continues to be.  Every movement is difficult and very restricted (some not even possible) the abdominal cavity is highly compressed, and I'm physically very weak. I remain 20kgs under my former weight, and can't do any physical activity save some light walks. The feeling in my abdominen and abdominal wall is that of wearing a tightly bound, hardened corset under my skin.  

I’m a shadow of my former self in every sense, and I’m only 32 years old. My hope is that someone here can make sense of my case, and help me find a surgeon who can fix my abdominal wall, so that I regain some assemblance of my life.","My case has been a mystery to every doctor and specialist I've consulted with. Even those that offered surgical solutions confessed to having never seen a case like mine before. It is impossible to overstate the devastating effect on my life, and in addition to a solution, I am also looking for an explanation - some way to make sense of what has happened to me.",Abdominal or digestion,Abdominal Wall Musculature,,False,,120000,False,False,True,Elite,Elite,2020-08-04T22:46:52.453Z,529153d04dbda80200000011,34,8 years 2 months ago,"Canterbury, New Zealand",711,{},"{""quality"": {""total"": 72, ""count"": 18}, ""difficulty"": {""total"": 61, ""count"": 17}}",20000,"[""5430b0d5a815930200000102"", ""537d537eeecfe1020000003c"", ""54dd471b45539f0300000167"", ""54fa1289fc0f120300000042"", ""542b01ca0b01d80200000065"", ""54e013fbb9211d03000001fb"", ""550933893b5ebb03000001b2"", ""556f7ce9a107dd03000000b0"", ""536bf878eb26b6020000009e"", ""5496241dccf6d40200000022"", ""515ec23b604a39df390003e3"", ""57683bf73333d00300e0fa7e"", ""51c3356a4eabf50200000069"", ""52cf7ef03b4288020000001a"", ""54947e0ea3ddfa02000001bc"", ""533ee7cb5472b702000000d0"", ""5599d0ee94494d0300000051"", ""5405e57a294d7c0200000046"", ""549f3f2e6398ea0200000142"", ""564b9e667ded6003000001b6"", ""544179f0c8addb0200000021"", ""53fdffb60ece1e0200000204"", ""53b37397a8cce502000000be"", ""538835be99082f0200000031"", ""5644f98660ad7b03000000bc"", ""5ee7848ef774a404006c37d8"", ""5b180269a8284a040094e8c0"", ""5a19b8511ec2f30400a406ae"", ""5876294ddc3acc04007ddea5"", ""528d36896c1e7f0200000026"", ""585a8beb6d6e0c0400c03a2c"", ""515ec23b604a39df3900006b"", ""54cd0e66278e81030000005f"", ""53385482d8d13b0200000028"", ""548fb68c99cfcb02000004e5"", ""53208a5347b47a020000001b"", ""533f6597357f5c0200000051"", ""537a6ad3a408e00200000054"", ""58ba40d447d7b2040081c99d"", ""5afb6371b0b16c0400432cf4"", ""5ab1bd3153008e0400fb1abd"", ""5ab0744923c1580400dca281"", ""51c58926c47e4e020000011e"", ""57875dc07cce3703009bb07d"", ""57e978717e69640300973f93"", ""5575c7565943cb0300000064"", ""554f0a2e29a2c00300000097"", ""560bd658626e1203000000a0"", ""56a6e9480f2f6e0300e20d82"", ""53c9c3db0c6dcc020000002d""]",[],"[{""full"": ""https://s3.amazonaws.com/crowdmed/patient_uploads/4-wrimwg.fhkbt3ayvi.pdf.pdf"", ""size"": 4289970, ""filename"": ""My Case History - Kirk Kaye.pdf"", ""_id"": ""5f29e55c613f260400c57f72""}]","[""5f29f5e6e744580400d71c6c"", ""5f2b41fcf0ba1b040039b14f"", ""5f2f53fad4ba3b04000e822f"", ""5f48cfeb67c30e040094c54a""]","[""https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1tqo2d9l3cu1jXDUXa35XwYOXK5QdjyKd?usp=sharing"", ""https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1SZVFfuwV5CSXWNRtCL-Aoz5Cl1GFOyIG?usp=sharing"", ""https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Lv2yxq2jfKpmNseDiV-JQp5AwrOYOjkG?usp=sharing"", ""https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1zCCpuaTeZK6tjImbkk7ivu3TfTyqCiXa?usp=sharing"", ""https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1-4y3FuOOQTbHfkACDKLrAXcr2lmxqnDe?usp=sharing"", ""https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1MOyYyu4yneq3uojKM0l2YJd3c2MSIqA3?usp=sharing""]","[{""name"": ""Joint or muscular"", ""selected"": true, ""_id"": ""5f135de5a2689e0400a2996c"", ""explanation"": ""The core issue is my abdominal wall muscles.

20549,18,Brant,male,Caucasian/White,NZ,New Zealand,1991,January,1991,January,"Good day :) 
I have a lifelong history which I believe is relevant, so I'm going to combine the multiple text boxes for a single narrative.

History:

Under 5 years old: 
Asthma, in and out of hospital with attacks. Start on Ventolin and Flixotide, continue until teens.
Alopecia.
Dislocated shoulder while opening door. Traumatic and no bone breaks or major injuries since.
Never wanting to go to sleep then never wanting to get out of bed
8 years old: ADHD suggested, no meds, therapy or treatment was deemed necessary.
Lots of fears and phobias.
10 years old: start to notice OCD like ticks.
12 years old: start to get depression. Start talk counselling.
14 years old: various forms of bullying, panic attacks, trauma, major depressive breakdown, PTSD, paranoia developing, OCD increasing. Could never pay attention or value school teachings, but this is becoming increasingly disruptive to all.
18 years old: Insomnia, 3-4 hours sleep each week night. Catch up on weekends. OCD very bad and have developed strange OCD somatic loop where I would fear something hitting my throat (fist, corner of table, knife etc.) and my compulsion was to tuck my chin down to 'protect' it. An increasing feeling of vulnerability in the throat seems to be developing. Start to notice sweaty hands and feet.
21 years old: nervous panic attack that causes hands and forearms to seize up and become cold and sweaty.
22 years old: Major OCD breakdown. Dissociation. Start CBT. Psychosis becoming apparent, mostly delusions, making meanings/narratives. No hallucinations. 
26 years old: Major psychosis breakdown. Start with psychiatrist. No offical diagnosis. Start medications: Respiridone, seems to ease mind, two weeks in Akathisia develops. Akathisa lasts several weeks, eventually cured on the spot by energy healer. Change antipsychotics many times, akathisia returns every time. Start Escitalopram for OCD, effect is hard to notice, strange phenomenon occurs whereby it is becoming increasingly difficult to ease my mind when doing my neck chin tuck compulsion, and noticing that it has been there for so long and must be OCD. Over a few days the ability for the compulsion to neutralise the throat feeling wanes, and the feeling becomes ever present. Most debilitating thing I have ever experienced. For me it felt like a suffering composed of physical, psychological, emotional and spiritual pain. I spent about a year there, balancing coping with trying to use mindfulness and acceptance and various physical therapies to ease it. Gradual as ever, it slowly faded away.
Start waking up through out the night. Try many sleep medications. Nothing works. Normal sleep returns after a year.
27 years old: lack of energy prompts start on Ritalin. Most positive response ever from medication. Start pregabalin when sleep becomes difficult again. Great feeling of bodily relaxation. Start journey on idea of 'dropping out of my head and into my body'.
28 years old/present: Things get very odd as I really start focusing on inhabiting my body. Building on my yoga and meditation practise I start trying many different physical therapies including different types of massage, chiropractic, cranial sacral, holistic pulsing, energy healing, acupuncture, exercise, stretching, cracking joints, full body skin scrubbing/exfoliating, shakti mat etc. My gut slowly seemed to come alive, in almost a painful way at first, with a whole new world of sensation. I was still struggling to connect with the rest of my body and eventually I traced a vague sense of numbness back to my throat. My larynx seemed so numb that I didn't even register it and once I realised this I could follow this feeling of numbness throughout my body. I began slowly massaging and reconnecting with my larynx. 

Many strange things have begun to happen over the last few weeks as sensation has come back into my larynx. I'm going to just list these without much context, as it's all a bit of a blur to me sorry!

Continued in next box...","Feeling of right body dominance, right eye dominance, thumb/index/middle finger dominance, ring/pinky finger feel anxious/weak/incapable/uncoordinated.
Whole right side of body feels 'blocked' right down to my foot and even the right side of my penis, which leans right too, and a hemorrhoid I developed recently feels like its on the right side too.
Read about VCD online and consider that I have this as well as asthma, as I suddenly recognise the feeling that my vocal folds require almost an 'opposite' energy. With this insight I start to explore the ideas of tantric masculine and feminine energies within the body. I suddenly felt like my left side was blocked too, but it almost felt like it required this opposite energy to relax and unblock it. So I slowly start trying to heal the connection between my body and mind, the throat, and gradually push and pull energy down and around my body. I begin to start feeling muscles all over my body I wasn't aware of previously and I begin tensing and stretch and massaging all these.
I begin to feel very 'wide'. 
I hear about 'mewing' online and this kicks off discovering all these new muscles in my head, face, neck, jaw, mouth, tongue, palate, back of the head, around my eyes. Feel like I learn to relax my eyes for the first time. My peripheral vision becomes more pronounced, calming, soft. 
My practise of neck cracking develops as I begin to find and release hidden tensions in my neck. My neck slowly becomes incredibly free moving and every new direction and twist comes with these 'rice bubble' crackle sounds. All the while my ears are becoming more and more open and I am hearing very differently and my jaw is loosening up. My life long blocked nasal passages are completely open.
The V between my collarbones has widened.
I've learned to swallow properly and my larynx has dropped. My testicles rose up into my groin momentarily. My pubic area feels different. I seem to be able to consciously ejaculate out of one testicle, then the other. 
My core/abdominals feel stronger. I no longer desire biting my nails which has been a lifelong habit. My hand and feet sweating has stopped. My hair has started growing thicker and standing up on top of my crown.
I am calmer and slower moving and grounded.
I began reading about left brain right brain ideas and these resonated with me. My head feels much wider and I can feel the difference between when my left or right brain is dominant, rather than being caught between the tension. I almost feel like the left and right sides are developing at the same time as finding balance, so I am having a bizarre experience where I'm almost developing my logical and creative awareness simultaneously. I feel almost quite suddenly alive, as if I had been living a biologically narrow-minded existence, quite literally.
I have also started regularly using cannabis, and this has been an invaluable tool as I feel that the CBD/THC harmony almost corresponds to my left brain/right brain and mind/body balance. I use different strains with different CBD/THC ratios depending on what I need at that moment.

I guess that's where I'm up to now.

25430,6,Andy,male,Caucasian/White,Pennsylvania,United States,1985,December,2014,September,"In 2014 after sharing a friend's unwashed hockey equipment a raised red and itch patch about 20mm x 4mm appeared on the left thigh crease. After not responding to  clotrimazole, an prescription antifungal was given to treat the area. 

During the first week of treatment, patient had a 5mm x 2mm purple rash appear on the corona of the penis head. This appeared after masturbation 1 evening, where the patient did not throughly wash his hands after applying the antifungal cream. The red patch on the inner thigh went into full remission after 2 weeks of anti-fungal treatment, but the spot on the head of the penis remained. Over the course of the next few months, three more similar purple patches appeared on the corona of the glans. The patches having an itching/burning sensation multiple times throughout the day. Since 2014 the balantis has remained, along with occasional reoccurrence of rash on inner thigh, which does respond to topical anti-fungals. In 2018 a red rash on the left side of the anus, that is itchy/burning and scaly is now continually present. This patch responds to topical antifungal, in terms of reducing size, but full remission has not occurred. 

Patient has been seen by GP, urologist and dermatology. Dermatology had 8 doctors inspect and determine it is ""probably eczema"".

As of 2015, Topical antifungal (all OTC options and presently 2% ketoconazol) have been tried, without success on balantis. Topical steroids have been tried daily for weeks in the following order (2% hydrocortisone; 0.025% triamcinalone, and 0.025% fluocinalone.) with no improvement. All detergents and soaps in the house have been changed to dye and scent free, and there has been no improvement.

In April 2022 oral dose of 150mg fluconazole was given with an second dose after 48 hours. Rash on anus disappeared after second dose. Balantis spots became lighter in color and burning sensation improved, but 3 days after the second dose, is still present. Patient requested a prescription renewal, but GP is not convinced balantis is fungal in nature.","Patient had no major medical illnesses or surgery.

Patient's BMI has ranged from 24 to 30 since infection occurred.

Patient developed Hepatitis C in 2015 likely after vaginal sex, possibly due to weakened skin barrier on head of penis. Patient cleared hep C without treatment, and had a negative PCR test in 2018.

Patient's A1C was borderline pre-diabetic in 2018, will be retested next week.

From 2012-present patient has had frequent loose stools and very low tolerance to spicy food. As of 2020 has improved with daily probiotics.","Grandmother: Lung cancer, type 2 diabetes

I ALWAYS experience dizziness and ringing in my ears. It has not gone away since my heart surgery in May of 2018. The dizziness gets so bad that I feel like I'm going to fall forward and to my left side all of the time. I have noticed it gets worse every late morning (between around 9 and 11am). I eat lunch and it gets better but then is horrible again after lunch (around 1pm). My ears are always ringing in the evening as well.

90466,14,Christopher,male,Caucasian/White,California,United States,1998,July,2015,September,"Christopher is 22 years old and for five years has suffered from a constant (24/7) severe headache. 

At the first onset, the symptoms/characteristics were very different than they are now, so the ""original"" headache that started suddenly in September 2015, the August 2016 craniotomy, and minor car accident that followed shortly after the surgery are all described in the Patient's Medical History).  

Here we are describing the current headache and other symptoms, which has been in force since 2016.

The most serious symptom now is a constant aching band of pain across the lower part of the back of his head and top of his neck. The band of pain is about 3.5 inches high (approx. 2.5 inches on the head down to where the neck joins the head including about 1 inch of the top of the neck). It's about 5 inches across and shaped roughly like a rectangle. This band of pain includes the craniotomy incision for the endoscopic resection in August 2016, but the pain is not worse along the edge of the incision itself. The perimeter of the rectangular band of pain (3.5""X5"") does not change, but where it hurts the most within this rectangle moves around somewhat (more left or right, higher or lower).

Being upright, either sitting or standing--now for even as short a period as a half hour--makes his pain worse. Lying down decreases the pain somewhat, not immediately but over a few hours. The clearest cause of increased pain is upright activity. Extended upright activity, even a one-stop cross-country airplane trip, causes a lasting increase in head pain that takes multiple days to recover from (lying down for even longer periods). The pain can get worse randomly, but it is consistently worse with more activity.

Christopher takes Buprenorphine under the supervision of a chronic pain management specialist to keep the pain low enough so that he is able to stay in college (on a reduced course load--now one course per term), but this has gotten increasingly difficult to do as upright activity seems to bring on more pain, more quickly as time has passed. 

He was a top student and wanted to study physics at college but cannot handle standing for labs because increase in activity/moving/being upright creates significantly higher pain, so he changed to math for now. When he is more active, the increased pain always hits him immediately and sometimes continues with increased pain the day after also. He always pays with pain for being more active for some period of time immediately afterwards and sometimes into the next days. 

The pain (on Buprenorphine) varies from 3-7 on the pain scale, and most of the time it is 4-5. The pain can be worse, seemingly randomly, and it can get worse with stormy weather or from stress, but it is definitely worse from more activity very consistently. He also has noticed recently that eating seems to cause his head to hurt more in the same location.

A few other symptoms he has noticed:

1) His shoulders down to his elbows, as well as his upper and lower back, are sensitive to touch and actually hurt if someone presses on his skin. It is “cape-like” in the area it covers (MRIs have not clearly shown a syrinx).

2) He has joint pain (hips, knees, lower back). The hip/knee/lower back pain can be bad enough to keep him awake at night. He's also noticed that he needs to shift his weight frequently in bed (every 5-10 minutes) to avoid increased hip pain.

3) He has visual snow/flashing lights in his field of vision at all times (he tested negative for Papilledema). This symptom started in 2015 with the first sudden onset of the original headache. The other symptoms he has noticed more recently.

He is able to manage all of these other symptoms. I am mentioning them on the off-chance that they are helpful in diagnosing his head/neck pain.","General medical history prior to first serious headache:

Christopher was very healthy with no medical issues from birth to age 12. He was very large at birth (11 pounds 2 ounces), and other than an MRI at age 1 because he had a surprisingly large head (no abnormalities/encephalitis found), he had no major medical problems or hospitalizations. 

At age 11, he started to have episodic migraines about once a month. They responded pretty well to triptans.

At age 12, after having been on the wrestling team for the first time in the winter, he got pretty severe chronic migraines in the Spring. He also started having a lot of sinus infections {Given his build--very tall and lanky, he was put in the same weight class as boys much shorter and stockier. As a result he was taken down a lot, including hitting the back of his head on the mat. Later wrestling was mentioned in the press as causing problems through too many non-concussive but harsh hits to the back of the head. At the time, I did not think about it but during the first year of the nonstop headache, I thought about it a lot, wondering if that had dislodged the posterior fossa Arachnoid cyst. The cyst was viewed as the cause of the original headache he got in 2015 as per below}

In 2013 at age 14, he broke the growth plate in his left ankle while at wrestling practice early in the season and therefore he did not wrestle (and he did not have chronic migraine in the following spring).

In 2014 at age 15 was on wrestling team for the last time and had terrible chronic migraines the following spring. 

In February 2015, Christopher had out-patient balloonoplasty sinus surgery to deal with sinus infections, also hoping to address the spring migraines.

In Spring 2015 he started allergy shots in attempt to alleviate any possible allergic reaction contributing to Spring migraines (tested only as mildly allergic to Spring pollen but decided to do shots anyway).

From Sudden Onset of First Serious 24/7 Headache:

In September 2015 (age 17), Christopher came home from high school with a sudden ""deep"" and overwhelming headache that was unlike anything he had ever experienced, and it continued, unabated, 24/7, until the August 2016 surgery described below.

Migraine was ruled out because his migraines are left-sided, behind the eye, and respond to preventative and abortive meds and ""end"" in a state of no pain within 24 hours. This was different than a migraine in that it would not stop, no matter what, and it felt like it was deep in his head and moved around in terms of where on his head the pain felt like it was coming to the surface (front/back/high/low). 

Nothing helped mitigate it. Even Vicodin gave only slight pain relief and he took it to get through big events like SAT and ACT. 

Many tests (sleep, ECG, etc.) were performed with no apparent abnormality (though his sleep study showed no REM, they thought it was just from the lack of enough time). 

MRI imaging showed a posterior fossa arachnoid cyst (AC) and an upright MRI with CINE showed that the CSF flow was altered by the AC. The AC was viewed as the only possible cause of this unrelenting pain (the only other symptom that started with the head pain was constant visual snow which continues today though he has tested negative for Papilledema). 

On 8/17/16, an endoscopic resection of the posterior fossa AC was performed with the purpose of opening up CSF ""dynamics/flow."" The 8/17/16 AC removal surgery seemed to alleviate the ""deep"" headache. Christopher was off all pain meds within 2 weeks of the surgery and back to school 3 weeks post-surgery. His biggest symptom post-surgery was profound exhaustion. He did have a nagging unexplained neck pain right after the surgery that he hoped was post-op pain. It may have been related to the complete left vertebral artery dissection because he did have a couple of days near the beginning of the post-surgical period where he was dizzy. The dissection was found in a later 2017 MRA and when the dissection occurred is unclear. Two neurosurgeons and his neurologist thought it happened during the surgery while others thought it could have been from the car accident 8 weeks following the surgery described below.

Mid-October, eight weeks post-op, Christopher was in a minor car accident. While stopped at a stoplight, he was hit perpendicularly from the right side at the very front of his car. The oncoming car ripped off the front fender of his car as it continued past. His head/body didn’t hit anything inside the car, the air bag didn’t go off, and he felt no pain at the scene--just dazed. He felt no pain the rest of that day. The next day he woke up with severe pain up the back of his head to the top (diagnosed as occipital neuralgia) and down his neck into his back. 

When painkillers, rest, and various treatments didn't work, it was recommended he try nerve ablations on the C2-C6 facets of his cervical spine, which he did from Fall 2017 to Spring 2018. He had several nerve ablation treatments each on a section of the C2-C6 facets guided by CAT-scan. This eliminated much of what was diagnosed as occipital neuralgia up the back of his head and also the pain in his lower neck/upper back. On the second-to-last treatment on right C-2, the pain was suddenly significantly worse on the right afterwards (and continues to be worse at this level of his neck, across). He did not go back to do left C-2. 

After these nerve ablations, he was left with the current band of pain including the bottom of the back of his head and the top of his neck described in ""Current Symptoms."" This area of pain was ""set"" and hasn't changed from Spring 2018 to now except that he seems less able to function over time.

Taking tramadol, he was able to start college in the fall of 2018, though it was clear he was suffering with the pain and was decreasingly able to function over time.

As an aside, Christopher is very tall and lanky (6' 4"" and 200 pounds) with a very long torso and still what appears to be a large head and long neck--none of this a medical problem in itself, but if his misery is caused by head/neck nerves/muscle problems, he does have a large head, long neck and does stoop a bit to talk to people much shorter than himself.","Migraine runs in mother's side of family including Christopher's grandfather (migraine aura but no pain), his mother with chronic migraine (starting age 29), his aunt with episodic migraine, and recently his younger brother (age 18) who has been diagnosed with migraine with cluster features.

No one has had any kind of severe chronic headache like Christopher has that we know of.","Christopher was a top science and math student throughout high school with close to perfect ACT/SAT scores (35 and 1590, respectively) even though he took them in late 2015 on Vicodin a few months after the original head pain was in full force. He has ADHD, inattentive type, but with medication he can focus intently. He is very academically minded and was quite ambitious before the 5+ years of pain he has endured and continues to endure; he wanted to be a scientist and make a contribution to the world and he hopes he will be able to do this but feels discouraged about the level of pain he is in and the number of years of it.

The pain can get him down, but with support from family, friends, and the anti-depressants he takes, he is very stable mood-wise as he always has been. Christopher has never smoked, drank, or used drugs.","Two pdf files are attached. One is a compilation of radiology reports on the imaging performed just now in 2020 back to 2012 in reverse chronological order. The second file contains the most recent neurosurgeon and headache specialist medical notes about his case from 2019, and the 2016 post-op notes by the surgeon who removed the arachnoid cyst.

He had many other tests in 2016 efore we decided on surgery, e.g., sleep study, 24-hour EEG, eye test, upright MRI with CINE, Catscans, X-rays of neck. We have all of these reports but have only included the ones that seem most relevant. Can upload additional reports as needed.

The consensus in 2016 was that the arachnoid cyst was causing the deep headache. Then, after endoscopic resection of this cyst, he was off painkillers for several weeks before he had the car accident. A set of MRI/MRAs showed that his left vertebral artery had been completely blown out at some point between pre-surgery and spring of 2017 though his current symptoms are not viewed as being related to this. We did get two neurosurgical opinions in the DC area in 2017. They did thought the left vertebral dissection was caused by the surgery and not the car accident, but they did not think that surgery would help the pain he was in based on the MRI/MRA images.

After the nerve ablations (2017-2018) seemed to solve for the post-MVA pain high up his head and far down his neck but not for the remaining bottom of head/top of neck rectangular band of pain, we were referred to a neurosurgeon to evaluate for CSF leak.

This neurosurgeon saw Christopher in October 2019 and ordered a brain and full spine MRI to evaluate for CSF leak/s (none found) and other potential causes of his pain. From a combination of the images and an in-person exam during which he questioned Christopher about the post-op/pre-accident period as well as the exact location of his pain now, he gave the opinion that the pain is from surgical scar tissue plus a new slight chiari malformation-like drop of the brain, both of which are seen in the MRI images on the same approximate horizontal axis within the Foramen Magnum (FM). 

This neurosurgeon diagnosed Christopher as having a ""severe CSF blockage"" in the FM which he sees as causing the exact location and severity of the pain he is experiencing. He recommended a second craniotomy to remove the scar tissue and perform a generous decompression including skull bone removal/C1 to unblock and increase the CSF flow. The surgeon stated that the general co-location of the prior surgical incision and the blockage indicates post-surgical scarring [and not cyst(s)]. He also thinks that the flow is probably blocked more when Christopher is upright, which accounts for the increase in pain from upright activity (and that this even greater level of blockage is not seen in the MRIs because MRI images are taken when the patient is supine).

Christopher was referred to another neurosurgeon for a second opinion. Based on all of the same reports and images up through the October 2019 imaging and diagnosis, the second neurosurgeon, who saw him in December 2019, delivered an opinion diametrically opposed to the October 2019 neurosurgeon's. In her view:
1) The CSF blockage is minor/irrelevant
2) It could not be causing such a localized band of pain
3) Surgery will not help and she strongly recommended against it. She went so far as to question whether the CSF flow was really blocked at all, saying that “images can be misleading,"" and that ""after all, the CSF is getting through…” 

She recommended to continue to investigate potential nerve/musculature causes for the pain and corresponding non-surgical pain intervention treatments because she viewed this as having a higher likelihood of being the correct area/set of issues causing the pain.

+++++++++++

We are now seeking out the opinions of two more neurosurgeons, both with experience in diagnosis of CSF flow issues at the juncture of the brain and spine as well as chiari-malformation-type illness. The attached most recent September 2020 MRI images and report are part of this current search for a more definitive neurosurgical opinion with some consensus on the diagnosis and potential surgery to address the problem. The most recent radiologist's report from the 9/1/2020 MRIs Christopher just had done indicates a potential problem related to the original endoscopic surgery but characterizes it in different medical terms including ""a small amount of encephalomalacia in the left posterior cerebellum."" We have not yet talked to the neurosurgeon who ordered this last set of images.

We are prepared to investigate other diagnoses along the lines of a nerve/muscle source of the pain and additional non-surgical pain intervention remedies. There is nothing appealing about another craniotomy except if it viewed by at least 2, if not 3, experts as being the answer for a diagnosis which is also generally agreed on.

In Christopher's case, we very much need a clear diagnosis of where the pain is coming from. Only with that will we feel confident about what path to take on what to do about it.","Christopher was always a dreamy kid and is very intelligent. Since this chronic head pain seized his life, he struggles with it, has good days and not so good days, but he keeps going, which, as his caregiver, I view as the epitome of human strength and perseverance.

The constancy and level of the pain is horrific. Watching him in pain and watching others question the seriousness of his pain (because unlike other illnesses, you can't see headache pain) is awful too. He has always been a stoic person and a doctor once said he ""presents"" as being in better shape than he actually is, which is true. When we have talked about this, he has indicated that he puts on a good front partly to avoid the social stress of having harebrained diagnoses and cures thrown at him, and partly to avoid having to talk about how bad the pain is when there is not much to talk about, especially since the other person can't see it/doesn't understand it and there is no agreed-to diagnosis of it.

His life is definitely much worse every minute, hour, day and year than it is for me as his caregiver, but it is awful all the way around. Five years is a very long time, especially for such a young person. He had had periods short periods of chronic migraine but the headaches always ended before the next one started and they were confined to a few months in the spring for a few years. In the fall of 2016 he was basically struck down and robbed of 5 big years of life so far, 17 to 22. These years would fade quickly in his memory and become unimportant in the scheme of things, but only if and when the current level and constantness of the pain is behind him. In the current situation, every birthday is a reminder of how much agony he has endured, and how uncertain the future is without having a clear diagnosis and path forward--a reminder to him and to me.","Christopher is such a wonderful young man--wise beyond his years, caring of others even with such unrelenting pain, and unusually intelligent both intellectually and emotionally. He has so much to give and should have so much life ahead of him during which to give it.

His life literally depends on lowering (or, even better, ending) the debilitating pain he suffers from all day and all night, year after year.

Episode may stop for 4 - 5 months or, instead, may go into phase where vomiting triggered only by liquids (and only liquids are vomited - food does not come up) Current episode is > 150 days without any relief, now cycling into acute phase again. Antiemetics don't work. Associated with significant pain under left rib (splenic area). Also vague association with any kind of smoke (i.e., barbeque smoke).  May have bouts of diarrhea and bloody stools during episodes but lower GI issues do not last entire length of episode. When present, food may pass directly through in minutes as if undigested. Associated symptoms like allergic reaction at times - hives, painful petechia in throat, burning red skin, running nose, sneezing.  Patchy skin on face and buttocks. Menstrual cycle completely irregular unless on pill. Blood pressure and heart rate rise to > 150/120 and >110 bpm in evening returning to normal when sitting/lying.  Renal calculi (unsure if related to dehydration).  Significant but intermittent pain in LLQ (sigmoid colon). Bicornuate uterus and rotated kidney reported on CT.

41969,13,Forest,male,Caucasian/White,California,United States,1970,October,2011,January,"Patient's primary issue is unexplained hand pain and loss of use of fingers / hands. Constant 8-10 on pain scale in hands, feeling as if bones are smashed inside- a throbbing, deep ache with stabbing pain / ""lightning bolts"" when used plus weakness and periods of numbness in hands and arms, shins and feet. Hands do not fully open or close, <2 lbs. strength in each finger. Pain originally began 7 years ago with a nodule in the palm that appeared after moving something heavy, fingers became less flexible and pain increased over time. Pain is worse if hands are used to grasp and lift; flexibility varies by finger and is least pronounced in thumbs. Painful nodules in palms originally suspected to be Dupuytren's Contracture for which radiotherapy was given at UCSF, but the rest of symptoms do not coincide; Dupuytren's Contracture is not supposed to be painful and only pulls in, it doesn't stop fingers from closing as patient is experiencing. X-rays and MRIs of hands do not show anything specific that would be causing the inflexibility / dysfunction. 
 
 Tendon pain continues through body (elbows, hips, knees, shoulders) with tightness and feeling of being ""strung up"". Patient is often contracted / bent slightly upon standing, bends knees to put feet flat on bed at night, and must sleep only on his back with hands at his sides. Otherwise hands go numb, and he raises them until they have feeling again. Flexibility seems to be increased only after a hot shower. It is the same every day but seems to get worse as time passes. Weakness in right arm was recently made worse after 30 vials of blood were taken in one sitting upon rheumatologist's request. This was 2 months ago and pre-blood draw strength has not returned to that arm. 
 
Hand specialists, physiatrists, surgeons, rheumatologists, neurologists, radiologists, chiropractors and more cannot explain why this is happening. Patient is no longer able to work due to constant hand pain and poor use of fingers in conjunction with general sense of fatigue, EMF sensitivity and digestive issues.","Patient was an active, athletic person without any significant illnesses, injuries or surgeries save routine things like tonsillectomy, removal of wisdom teeth and minor hockey injuries.  

Symptoms appeared to get much worse after an antibiotic shot received in a hospital in response to an infected bug bite on the knee; patient felt tightness around his head and tingling that went throughout his body and he passed out. Some of his symptoms coincide with Fluoroquinolone-Associated Disability and this is one of the issues we suspect. He did take a few anti-acne medications as a child and had traditional fillings containing mercury that were removed a few years ago. 
 
Tested high for allergies (grasses, dander, etc.) as a child; sensitive to gluten and dairy.","Patient had two older brothers, one recently passed away. Neither had any significant health issues we were aware of. Father, now deceased, passed in his sleep from an enlarged heart. Uncle on his father's side has had quadruple bypass surgery and two other uncles also passed away from heart disease. Medical history on mother's side and grandparents' sides are unknown.","Patient has always been an active, healthy person and has eaten home-cooked organic food for many, many years. Prior to the illness, he would rollerblade / skate for miles at a time, play tennis, play video games and worked as a technical recruiter.","Most recently, MRIs without contrast of brain, cervical and thoracic spine were unremarkable. 30 vials of blood drawn by order of Rheumatologist 3 months ago were all within normal range except for Eosonophils, which were slightly elevated. MRIs and X-Rays of hands done several years ago (unremarkable), lots of blood and urine work.

34360,4,Kelley,male,East Asian,Michigan,United States,1972,November,2000,April,"Profile: 49 year old male with balance & vertigo issues since spring 2000. Last vertigo episode was in May 2018. Total # of vertigo episodes since 2000 is apprx 8. Balance and unsteadiness is continuous.   
Background  :  My forehead is always heavy throughout the year and my balance is off. Since the 2018 vertigo episode, I have a difficult time waking up from bed and need to be very careful doing so. All vertigo episodes that I recall, were triggered while waking up. I cannot turn to my right and sleep since it triggers a very uncomfortable feeling in my head that feels like I am going to pass out or have a dizzy spell. I also cannot lie down on a flat surface and need to have an elevated pillow. I wake up twice in the middle of the night to urinate and sometimes feel wobbly in my head and can’t sleep for a while.  Other challenges include not being able to bend down and eat at a dining table. I also experience a momentary sensation of passing out while sitting (has happened numerous times but never really passed out), almost like an allergy attack in my head (excuse my lack of medical knowledge). I have chronic sinusitis and my septum is deviated. Also, my sense of smell is out and I have hypothyroidism. The last couple years I also have evening chills and starting this year heavy sweating while sleeping. There is also some gas and bloating even though my diet is primarily vegetarian with occasional consumption of chicken/fish (no red meat).
During my 21 year journey with most of the aforementioned symptoms, I have seen several specialists (general health, ENT, Neuro, Vestibular etc.) and also pursued alternative medical treatment with no success. They have evaluated me through the lens of their specialization and found no root cause. Needless to say I am frustrated and scared and need help. My confidence has taken a big hit and so has my quality of life. I am very circumspect in my movements and what I do, as a result.
In 2001, I did an MRI for my brain and it came back negative for any unwanted growth or abnormalities. My vestibular tests (done twice over a span of 7 years both came back negative). The vestibular doctor says I have BPPV and that is triggering the vertigo episodes. She had me do vestibular PT for Epley, however, she indicated that BPPV is not curable permanently nor the cause known (not a satisfactory answer). 
My daily regimen for sinus issues, include steam inhalation in the morning and sinus rinse in the evening along with Fluonase spray application twice. Temperature/humidity/pressure changes or even things like smoke etc easily irritate my sinuses. I also keep getting recurring headaches when there are significant weather changes suddenly (I resort to an advil pill when that happens).  The cold weather (the majority) of the year in Michigan doesn’t seem to help at all.  For my thyroid issue I take one 50Mcg of Levothyroxin on empty stomach every day (used to be 75mcg until a year ago). 
Last fall, I was tested positive for dust mite allergy and have since started immunotherapy for desensitization. Looking for a cure and trying to make sense of my world, I have in my mind made the connection between the allergy, chronic sinus and the balance issues as being all related. However, my specialist doctors do not share the same views (they believe that the connections are scientifically/medically inconclusive) and I am no medical professional.   
As noted above, my specialists have largely viewed the issues through their prisms and have been unsuccessful at any meaningful diagnosis or treatment. It has been a long and tough road and I am hoping with your collective expertise, I will have a chance to finally put these issues behind me and lead a more normal life.","Profile: 49 year old male with balance & vertigo issues since spring 2000.

Could it be mold in my house, or pollen or a completely new allergy that is exacerbating my asthma?

Would a bronchoscopy be in order to determine if there is something in my lungs that is causing this in combination with my compromised immune system?

15592,54,Alonzo,male,Caucasian/White,Michigan,United States,1990,March,2016,April,"PRIMARY SYMPTOMS:
A constant ongoing feeling of nausea that seems to have to clear cause to its timing and severity.  This nausea is slightly different then when I'm actually sick (from the flu, food poisoning, etc.) in that I don't get sweaty or clammy, and don't have the ""tingling"" in the face I normally do, this feeling of nausea is entirely felt in the stomach/throat.  Typically, the nausea is worst in the mornings and afternoons (usually around a 6 out of 10 severity) while becoming milder or going away completely in the evenings and nights.  Occasionally and seemingly at random (once or twice a week), nausea may be mild or gone in the mornings and/or severe at night.  On top of the constant nausea, there are episodes of more severe nausea (8 out of 10 severity) a few times a week that may last from 15 minutes to an hour.

The nausea usually coincides with a feeling of fullness or bloating in the stomach.  Eating typically helps reduce the feeling of nausea for a little bit (up to an hour) before it returns, but eating is difficult due to the symptoms.

I used to regularly work-out, but had to stop soon after these issues began as strenuous activity greatly increases the symptoms.

Despite how long I've been feeling nausea, I have never actually vomited from this.

HISTORY OF SYMPTOMS:
For several years I would experience about a week of nausea at the start of spring that I just figured was my body adjusting to the new season.  The first time I experienced these symptoms was toward the end of a work-out during the start of spring, so I figured that was the issue, as I felt better after a couple hours.  I waited a couple weeks before going back to the gym, but had to leave almost immediately due to the nausea returning but it, again, went away after a few hours.  This was the last time I worked-out after having doing it pretty regularly for years.  Over the course of the summer, the nausea slowly got worse and worse to the points that I was feeling it pretty much every day.  That first winter, the nausea mostly went away which, again, made me think it was some sort of allergy-related issue.  During that winter, I started having issues with random bouts of dizziness that would last about 5 minutes a few times per day.  I went to an ENT to check my ears and balance and they found no issues.  The following spring the nausea returned every day, again, making me believe it was some sort of allergy issue.  I had an allergy skin-prick test around this time and nothing stood out as being severe.  The symptoms did not go away the following winter, at which point I stopped believing it had to do with allergies, and I have been dealing with it almost every day for the following 3 years.

OTHER NOTES:
In this time, I have lost about 25 pounds due to general loss of appetite.  I was pretty skinny before this, so the 25 pounds was pretty noticeable.

I used to be comfortable or warm at temperatures where others are felt comfortable, but am now almost always cold when others are comfortable.  I assume this is due to no longer being physically active and the loss in body-weight but figured it might be worth noting.

I drink a lot of water and always have a water bottle with me.  My urine is usually clear, so I don't believe I am dehydrated.  I believe my desire to drink water is just because I feel sick and it helps with that, but again figured it might be worth noting.

When I lie down, my stomach makes a lot of rumbling noises, even if I am not hungry.  I notice this mostly when I go to bed, but if I lay down during the day, it still occurs.  My stomach also has episodes of these noises throughout the day, even when standing/sitting.

Throughout the day, I have uncontrollable burps that sound have more of a gurgling sound then a normal burp.  This is in addition to ""normal"" burps that I usually have more control over and sound more normal.

When I shower in the morning, I usually spend the entire shower spitting thick/mucus-y spit out and ""hocking loogies""

When I do fell hungry later in the day, the hunger comes on very quickly.  I will go from a full/sick feeling to being very hungry in a matter of a couple minutes.

Current Medications:
Omeprazole (seems to help slightly)
Simethicone (doctor had me take due to burping, doesn't seem to be helping)

(None of these seemed to help)","I feel like my entire life has been on hold for the past 4 years as I don't want to make any major life changes while dealing with this.  I lost my job about a year and a half after these symptoms started because my persistent symptoms lead me to taking many days off as well as made it hard to focus when I was working and I am afraid of the same thing happening at my current job.  I used to spend a lot of time out of the house, but these days, when I get home from work, I just want to stay at home and on weekends I tend to stay at home, also.  Luckily, since my symptoms tend to become milder in the evenings, I do manage to get out to see friends occasionally.  I no longer exercise, which was something I used to enjoy doing very much.","Moon-shot ideas:
1. About 2 weeks before these symptoms started, I began taking supplements that I ordered off of Amazon that consisted of about 10 capsules/pills daily in the morning and another 7 capsules/pills before exercising on days when I would go to the gym.  I have brought this up to doctors and they say it's a coincidence, but I've always had this in the back of my mind as a possibility.

2. Post-nasal drip?  For a few years before these symptoms started, I would get a feeling of nausea for about a week at the start of spring (about the same time of year that these symptoms started).  I always just figured it was just allergies causing post-nasal drip or something else.  Could this have become more permanent?

3.  Could my previous round of Accutane lead to something?  I remember signing a bunch of waivers saying it can lead to complications in the future, so this has always been in the back of my mind as a possibility.",Abdominal or digestion,Chronic Nausea,,False,,81500,False,False,True,Premium,Premium,2019-12-12T00:43:06.254Z,515ec23b604a39df390003e3,32,6 years 3 months ago,"Michigan, United States",948,{},"{""quality"": {""total"": 14, ""count"": 4}, ""difficulty"": {""total"": 10, ""count"": 4}}",4000,[],[],"[{""full"": ""https://s3.amazonaws.com/crowdmed/patient_uploads/4-jqfbrk.k6ku26s9k9.pdf.pdf"", ""size"": 4635270, ""filename"": ""Allergy Test-Copy-Copy.pdf"", ""caption"": ""Allergy skin-prick test results, performed December 6, 2017"", ""_id"": ""5deee3bd5c3c6004001c17d7""}, {""full"": ""https://s3.amazonaws.com/crowdmed/patient_uploads/4-wrp07i.mldfbw3ik9.pdf.pdf"", ""size"": 56395856, ""filename"": ""EGD 5-24-2017-Copy-Copy.pdf"", ""caption"": ""First Upper GI Endoscopy with biopsy results and images, performed May 24, 2017"", ""_id"": ""5deee3bd5c3c6004001c17d6""}, {""full"": ""https://s3.amazonaws.com/crowdmed/patient_uploads/4-13n4xl3.x6rw1att9.pdf.pdf"", ""size"": 46659777, ""filename"": ""EGD 10-8-2019-Copy-Copy.pdf"", ""caption"": ""Second Upper GI Endoscopy with biopsy results and images, performed October 8, 2019"", ""_id"": ""5deee3bd5c3c6004001c17d5""}, {""full"": ""https://s3.amazonaws.com/crowdmed/patient_uploads/4-1vnc8sa.khxdukrzfr.pdf.pdf"", ""size"": 952207, ""filename"": ""LabResults.pdf"", ""caption"": ""Lab results from blood work at several points over the past several years, before and after symptoms began.

-within days it turned into tingling sensations up the legs, in the hands
-then severe sensory nerve pain in thighs
-muscle/nerve twitches started in right hand
-then right bicep twitches, on and of
-now i have nerve/muscle twitches that appear basically anywhere on my body
- the sensory nerve pain in my thighs came in waves - my body would feel cold all over, then severe nerve pain in my thighs, then it would fade somewhat and leave my legs exhausted
- extreme skin sensitivity would come and go - i still get that sometimes, but less so
- sensations that my skin was hot in patches, would come and go - that still happens sometimes but not as much
-electric sensations in my legs and sometimes hands, at times I would feel as though my feet were vibrating (they were not)
- for the longest time when I would walk the bottom of my feet had altered sensation - felt ""squishy"" and sensitive. Walking on grass in bare feet was very unpleasant, for example. I had a hard time wearing socks and shoes. This is no longer as bad as it was
-presently i have discomfort in my legs and hands almost all the time, and nerve twitches from time to time. I feel like my passive grip strength (i.e. holding a phone, or a pen) wavers, but my overall strength remains good. 
- i have pain on the back of my hands, and top of my feet, much of the time. Sometimes I get the burning nerve problems in my thighs, but not as frequently as before
-at first all of this went up and down in severity (with my best state still being quite bad). Now it goes up and down in more gentle waves - and isn't as bad as it was in the beginning

All neurological tests are normal - no motor or muscle weakness
- this does cause sleep disturbance, although that might be stress (?). Symptoms are definitely worse after not sleeping well

-there were a number of things that immediately preceded the onset of symptoms:

1. Trip to Grand Canyon, developed a very large lesion on lip - not sure if it was a bite or a cold sore, eventually resolved after taking doxy. I do know that we slept in the presence of bats :-(
2. Respiratory illness (bronchitis? this was Oct, 2019 so before COVID)
3. flu shot

In the last several months I have started to have a different kind of pain at different parts of my body - deeper and duller pain - that comes and goes. It can appear in my arm, or shoulder, or behind my knee - usually it doesn't last long and then it moves somewhere else. I am not able to relate this to any activities","unremarkable - 
Partial thyroidectomy for indeterminate nodule (was benign)

Occasional cold sores","colon cancer - several family members

parksinsons - father and aunt","lawyer with a busy work life

fairly physically active - gym 3 times / week before the pandemic, still walk or cycle most days, ski in winter","MRI of entire neuraxis - normal

metabolic workup (TSH, B12,cbc, electrolytes, extended electrolytes and hba1c) all normal (one B12 test was borderline 255, took B12)

infectious workup (varicella, syphillis, mycoplasma, lyme, HIV, hepatitis, EBV, CMV, coccidiodes and SPEP all normal

EMG done - normal 

repeated neuro physical exams - all normal motor and reflexes

After this had gone on for 9 or 10 months, I decided to look for environmental causes. We tested the water in our house (normal), and also the output from a built in espresso machine. It turns out the boiler in that machine was leaching lead, zinc, cadmium. I immediately discontinued use of the machine (and had it tested), and had blood and urine tests done, which were later repeated by a toxicologist. All those tests were normal and the toxicologist did not believe that heavy metal poisoning was a major factor in my symptoms

House has been tested for mold - negative

repeat emg done May 2020 - normal","it has been difficult not knowing what is going on, or whether it will get better.

My partner (very healthy) has also suffered muscle twitching and diffuse pain - all his testing has been normal.

14027,18,Ronni,female,Caucasian/White,California,United States,1954,April,2013,January,"January 2013 my hands started to itch really bad ten I started braking out in hives. I had just moved to Olympia WA. so all the doctors up there said it must be that I am allergic to the mold and mildew up in WA because it rains a lot up there.  I moved back to Southern CA the hives lasted for another about 7 mos and they went away. None of the doctors in CA could figure out what it was either. I was free of them for about 2 yrs then they returned March 2018 and I still have them. I have paid lots of money to figure this problem out but nothing has worked. I went to an allergist and he put me on xolair shots 2 once a month and that helped. I was on it for 11 mos but had to go off of it because it caused joint pain and kidney problems. Now I am on methotrexate for a few months which suppresses my immunity to keep my body from making hives. It works OK I still get hives at night and then they get better during the day but come back at night so very hard to sleep. I basically drug myself so I can sleep because without sleep everything is worse. I have been on line FB with lots of mostly woman with CIU. Lots of the woman get the hives when they have there period, give birth they are 20 - 40 yrs old but I was 60 yrs old when I got the CIU the first time.",I was fine. All I had was low thyroid which did sometimes cause constipation and being tired. I was 60 years old when I got this for the first time and 64 years old when I got this for the second time which is not going away.,my parents die from natural causes. they never had health issues. My sister was born with cerebral palsy due to the long delivery.,I do not drink or smoke. I do not eat fast food. I try and eat healthy do walking for exercise. I have had lots of problems with shingles. I have had them many times. I got the old shingle shot in 2013 which I had a very bad reaction to it. In 2003 I had the gastric bypass and lost 70 lbs.,"I have had lots of blood test which show I am perfectly healthy. Thyroid test, parasitic test, acupuncture 3 times. Went to 2 natural path doctors.I had light laser therapy.I did three rounds of leaky gut repair.  No one could find out anything all my test come back that I am fine.",I feel that my biggest struggle is that in the evening the hives come back so it is very difficult to sleep and if you can not sleep it is hard to function in the daytime. it is hard to think or remember stuff.,On face book there are a lot of us out there with this mostly woman and we all seem to have thyroid and hormone issues. The hives seem to come back at night so very hard to sleep. I have taken and done mostly everything I can find on line to try and help myself.This disease will not kill me but living with this makes life miserable.

84090,8,Laura,female,Caucasian/White,Washington,United States,1990,December,2015,January,"My symptoms started about five years ago (~2015). I first noticed one small floater in my right eye when I was watching slideshow lectures in PT school. The floaters have now taken over my vision in both eyes, and completely disrupt my daily life. I can hardly read my computer screen at work or drive safely at nighttime. Some new symptoms in the past couple of years include intermittent stabbing pains in my right eye, false movement in my vision, double vision, visibility of my pulse, large greyish blind spots, and hundreds of thousands of sparkley-flashy specks on sunny days. I also have noticed a new onset of tennitus which I've never had before. Two significant medical events that closely pre-dated my symptoms was a kidney infection that put me in the hospital with sepsis overnight, and a long battle with mononucleosis that kept me sick/congested for 3-5 months.",I am a healthy 29 year old who has always been very active. This condition has not impacted my functional endurance with running/hiking/snowboarding.,None,"I sometimes have 2 or 3 drinks on Fridays and Saturdays. I'm not a tobacco user or drug user. PT school was very stressful for me, and I often wonder if my condition could be associated with undiagnosed high blood pressure from that time period.","The MRI of my brain and orbits was unremarkable. My CT scan showed complete opacification of my right maxillary sinus, and a large cyst in my left sinus. I'm having maxillary sinus surgery on to remove those next week, but the ENT is somewhat doubtful it will help me. I've had a neuro-opthamologist test my peripheral vision, color discrimination, and pin hole test for visual acuity which were all very good. He doesn't believe my condition has neurological etiology. I've also had an ultrasound to check out the chronically enlarged lymph nodes in my neck, but they were not ""pathologically enlarged"".","This has been the single most difficult battle I've ever had to face in my life. My symptoms are ever-worsening, and I still have no answers from the doctors. I have swerved on the road to miss floaters in my vision, and I have nearly had to leave work from the sharp eye pain/ headaches. Most of the opthalmic specialists I've seen will tell me that I'm young and healthy, and that they're ""not worried"" about me. I've been told by five retinal specialists that both my vitreous humor and retina look very healthy healthy and normal. I've had exhaustive bloodwork to look for autoimmune diseases, diabetes, thyroid disease, etc. My vision problems are all-consuming to me in my life experience, and I think I'm going to go blind if I don't find a diagnosis.","My mother thinks that my vision problems might be an iatrogenic reaction to a large bottle of ciproflaxin that I stood administered when I got sick in Central America. This was in 2012, three years prior to onset of symptoms.

Since 2014, I have been home bound; not been able to sit down almost at all, l cannot lay on my back or sides, and of course driving is out of the question. 

Tailbone/sacrum pain started back in September 2014. Then I had a coccygectomy back in Feb 2016. After a long 3 and a half years and counting, I think the surgery have not helped my condition much. My situation has not improved since, I am developing new pains and life restrictions, and I need help finding the appropriate medical care.","Arthroscopic Rotator Cuff Repair surgery, back in 2009.

Q&A
---

Q: How did the pain that led to your coccygectomy start? 

My pain started from excessive sitting while working on my computer.

---

Q: Was there any preceding injury? 

My tailbone area has always been sensitive I do remember having pain from sitting to standing many times in my life however it has always gotten better with less sitting (not this time though).
I did fall on my buttocks a few times but never felt long term pain.
Note: On the night before the coccygectomy 1-Feb-2016, I slipped and fell, breaking a part of my sacrum.

---

Q: Have you had children? Any problems with the pregnancies of deliveries?

I have 4 children normal pregnancies and natural deliveries.

12039,2,Zoe,female,Caucasian/White,Washington,United States,1983,November,2021,March,"Severe fatigue (constant), Severe brain fog, unilateral vestibular hypofunction, doctors said I present like TBI patient but with no impact to my head could not diagnose as TBI. 

March 2021, day of J&J Covid-19 vaccination, wrist drop of injection arm within 5 minutes, shooting pain down to my fingers and up to my ear through neck. Within 20 minutes tongue and throat swelling. Two hours later still racing heart then went unconscious, injection arm went numb, then severe pain, severe joint pain in injection arm, jaw pain back pain, doubled over abdominal pain. Took 3 hours for tongue and throat swelling to decrease. By evening, 104 F fever, lasted 9 consecutive days. Day 2 was unresponsive, then could not speak, move, or walk (but could hear). Memory loss. Loss of emotion, sense of time, severe light and sound sensitivity.

10 months of extensive medical testing unremarkable, except: 

Unilateral vestibular hypofunction identified in July. Severe dizzineness 
By August - elevated sCD40L, elevated RANTES, elevated IL-4, IL-10, Long Hauler Index
Led to diagnosis of vascular inflammation

But, negative antibodies to spike protein prior to vaccination, negative PCR prior to vaccination, continually negative PCR for COVID-19 after vaccintion, negative Nucleocapsid twice after vaccination, but continually increasing antibodies to spike protein across 5 months past injection. Negative T-Detect for all parts of COVID-19 virus. 

Swollen lymph post auricular (once or twice a month each month) - first identified as classic post vaccination, but doctors could not understand why it kept clearing and recurring. 

S1 found in non-classical monocytes 6 months after vaccination.

Differential diagnosis determined no underlying health conditions across 10 months

Physical Therapy eval in April saw left sided weakness, fall risk ""high,"" need for speech therapy, need for vestibular therapy. 

Speech therapy eval April 2021 suggested suspected significant decline from baseline - speech therapist said did not know what to do. 

Second opinon speech therapy January 2022 suggested need for speech therapy and visual tracking therapy (presented like TBI impact to visual scanning)

Symptoms that increase with cognitive load or physical activity or attempted balance: 
-light and sound sensitivity
- speech difficulty 
- balance difficulty 
- burning sensation across head (feels like skin burn)
-nausea

Symptoms that increase with mechanical motion:
- chewing crunchy foods make vision look like broken image stabilizer (shakey vision stops when motion stops

Symptoms that increase with head or body roation:
- dizziness
- nausea
- visual disturbance

Electric ""zap"" feeling in fingers seems random
Cold feet and hands 

localized reference right back of my head at the height of my right ear but half way between ear and center back of head. With flickering lights, cognitive load, balance tasks, that same location feels like pressure/strange sensation. If the stimulus continues, may lead to severe pain that radiates out from that location. 

Different type of headache (documentated across months in excel spreadsheet and looked for patterns) occurs about 2-3 days before swollen lymph emerges left post auricular 

These are not all symptoms, but some of the most prominent at 10 months out. 

Biological clock seems to be on differnt time zone (feels like jet lag). Least severe brain fog between 1-2 am.

Took no medications for the first 6 months.
Was taking pravastatan and Maraviorc, that normalized cytokine levels, but still elevated sCD40L. No longer on these medications, tapered off.","No health conditions. I had hardly gone to the doctor. 
Electronic medical records through 2003 showed all normal bloodwork. Normal MRI (was checked for headaches around 2004 - turned out to be low vitamin D). 

December 2021 learned that B vitamins addressed headaches.

Only surgery - wisdom teeth removal","Parents and brother all healthy.
Mom has never broken a bone (very atheletic through her younger years)

My dad did have skin cancer from being in the sun a lot, treated with topical chemo and recovered. 

Maternal grandfather died of heart disease from smoking and maternal grandmother of emphysema from second hand smoke (she never smoked - as a note, their dog died of a throat tumor - suspected smoke also)

Mother never smoked.","Did not take medications prior to vaccination (hardly ever any over the counter any medication). 

Never smoked, do not drink alcohol (had none before the age of 26, only a couple for social work events/international) and none since January 2020 (last was at an international work dinner). I don't like alcohol or caffeine or soda/sugary drinks, and mostly only drink water, ginger tea or peppermint tea. 

Never on any form of birth control.

Healthy food - do not eat meat (but gravy, broth, dairy etc), was highly active (dance, run, weights). My work was also on my feet all day. I traveled for work, public speaking, high cognitive load, researcher, and multiple tasks with need for quick decisions. Loved my job and have been devastated that it has been over 10 months and still not medically cleared to work, or drive.","10 months of extensive medical tests from X-ray, to MRI (did not occur until after a month after worst neurological symptoms), venogram, EEG, EMG, Echo cardio, zio patch, all was told ""unremarkable"" ruling out other possible underlying conditions. Substantial blood work (including Ferritin, CRP, CBC, Thyroid, HIV, Influenza A & B, Mono, fungus, virus, COVID-19 - all negative). 

Zio identified some tachycardia, PVC, PAC - but the cardiologist said this was normal (that testing did not occur until May - the worst chest pain was in March, most chest pain was reduced by then)

6 months after onset of symptoms, sCD40L 52845 pg/mL (ref 9236). 7.0 pg/mL IL-4. 1.7 pg/m IL-10, 12384 pg/mL CCL5 (ref 1180). 

Flow Cytometry found S1 in my non-classical monocytes still 6 months post injection.

Nov 2021: Long hauler index 4.2 (ref < 0.71).

Second opinion skin biopsy found high inflammatory response, but no fungus or bacteria. I was told similar pattern was seen in other vaccinted people. 

Neuro-ophthamologist and optometrist said eye structure unremarkable and vision consistent with vestibular condition or concussion
Have not been able to rule out microclotting.
Have not been able to rule out autoantibodies to ACE2","Prior to this, I had no idea how difficult it was to navigate health care because I didn't need it. 

I have been debilitated immediately following injection. I asked for risk before injection and was told by the nurse, ""there are no adverse reactions to J&J, not even anaphylaxis, because there is no PEG."" 

I trusted that ethical protocol was in place. I was told the vaccine was approved, safe, and would protect me from severe symptoms, from being a burden to the health care system (to prevent me from getting sick), and to prevent me from losing the ability to work. I was told I wouldn't have any adverse reactions. I have had doctors tell me for months ""there's nothing wrong with you."" It took getting the abnormal sCD40L and cytokines to show there was something wrong, and the physical therapy, speech therapy, and vestibular therapy all found aftermath of injury they said presented like concussion or traumatic brain injury, but no one could diagnose either because there was no point of impact externally. 

I have gone from not needing any medical care and being told by all my doctors I had no risks for severe COVID, to no longer being able to take care of myself, work, be independent, and have even had difficulty with verbally communicating, walking, and very basic function. 

I have had insurance constantly deny medical coverage because there was no other explanation outside of vaccination and my financial losses are in the 6 digits now. 

I have become a burden to people around me for driving me to medical appointments and rehabilitation, taking over work for me while I'm on disability, and can not even function with basic tasks. 

I have learned this experince is parallel to being a survivor of sexual assault. There is a lot of gaslighting, denyal, ""can you prove it?"" and ""no one will believe you"" and ""you know, you must have asked for it."" 

To hear doctors say, ""You are collateral damage for doing the right thing. No one will help you. If you care enough about the pain of others who come after you, don't give up."" is really hard. 

I have learned how pervasive this is, but most people are in hiding and needed to develop a secret code to not get blocked, banned, or disbanded for being labeld as ""misinformation"" - when we all got vaccinated because we weren't antivaxxers. 

I have found that there are no safeguards. CICP has compensated zero claims. The burden of proof is on the injured, and doctors are very concerned about identifying what they are seeing even if they speak it verbally, they will not put it in writing. I don't think they realize the impact this has on insuance companies. 

Within the vaccine groups, people are becoming despearte and trying to engage in citizen science to get any help or answers. It is so debilitating, plus the pressure of being ridiculed by antivaxxers (pointing at us as examples - no compassion) and by others calling us ""antivaxxers"" saying ""die"" and ""you're obscene - how dare you lie about symptoms. There are no reactions to vaccines."" (all the way up to cyberstalking)  - all of this on top of symptoms as severe as covid, long covid, with no compassion, no help from medical, denyal, and mounting medical bills, loss of work, life, being able to even take care of ourselves - it is leading to people dying by suicide. 

News journalists talk to some of us, then are told by their editors they cannot publish. 

I learned there were contaminated batches. When I recovered enough to notice what was happening to my parents, I had them take the cytokine panel too. They thought they were just stressed worried about me. Both of them were diagnosed with vascular inflammation also - we all had the same lot number. Our genetics show no risk factors for cloting, but all of us had elevated platelet activation. I have connected with others outside my familiy who got their vaccine in the local area within a day or two of ours, also with severe vascular complications. 

I tried tracking down my lot number. Janssen has information for lot numbers and place of manufacture and initially said yes, they could get that information to me, put me on hold, then came back and said that lot number was disconnected from place of manufacture. I reached out to CDC, FDA, local public health, because Janssen told me I could get the information from the government once the vaccine is distributed, it belongs to them and the manufacturer is just the distributer. None of those government agencies would provide me with information. I found J&J vaccine lot number look up and it read ""restricted/Do Not Use"" - I asked Janssen what it meant, but they said they didn't know. 

I submitted a FOIA request for the lot number, and my request was denied. 

I found this: https://oversight.house.gov/sites/democrats.oversight.house.gov/files/2021-06-22.CBM%20JEC%20to%20Soriot-AstraZeneca%20re%20Emergent..pdf#:~:text=As%20a%20result%20of%20these%20unaddressed%20manufacturing%20errors,doses%20of%20AstraZeneca%E2%80%99s%20vaccine%20due%20to%20suspected%20contamination%3B 

I have not been able to rule out that I have been injected with a contaminated lot.","PEG & Polysorbate 80 allergy ruled out. 
All other vaccine ingredients ruled out except antigen.

Microclotting has not yet been ruled out
Autoantibodies have not been ruled out

While many symptoms decreased with maraviroc and prevastatin, the neurolgical symtpoms and fatigure haven't resolved yet. 

A researcher said my neurologist could not have ruled out the possiblity of blood clots by looking at MRI as she stated. My neurologist said she has nothing left since my MRI was unremarkable, EMG was unremarkable, EEG was unremarkable, and autonomic test was unremarkable. I told her I would not seek help from her any further and the last thing I want is to be a burden on the medical profession (she seemed really annoyed with me and I told her I didn't want to be an annoyance to anyone. She at least replied that she just didn't know what to do, that she's ""just a clinician, not a researcher,""

The severity of fever and 9 consecutive days along with chest pain, inflamed/bloody skin, auditory (vestibular - caused by clotting or inflammation), neurological, gastrointestinal (bloody diarrhea), and vomiting, all seem to align with multisystem inflammatory syndrome early on, that may have led to long covid symptoms with immune dysregulation and ongoing cytokine storms.

It will present in waves of rib/trunk/back pain throughout the day. These pain moments are dubbed “pain spasms” by the patient because it locks all muscles and limbs up and is difficult to breathe and impossible to speak through. On a Very active day- the patient will have 10-50 pain spasms a day lasting 5-50 minutes. On a not active day maybe only 4 or 5 lasting 5-10 minutes.

70248,10,Mason,male,White,Maryland,United States,1998,May,2015,July,"College student, smart and kind, with good long-term friendships, diagnosed with Bi-polar w/ psychosis (severe) 2.5 (2019) years ago after hearing voices. 

Recovered to an near normal level (after addition of Lithium to anti-psychotic meds) regarding psychiatric issues and resumed full-time college, secured a great job and did very well. 

Now, there is something else going on here. He has multiple medical issues (see below) and for 10 months psychiatric meds are not effective. 

FYI- Currently Lives at home, no drugs or alcohol. Two hospitalizations in 4 months with Clean Tox screens. So there is no current drug use, no alcohol.

History:

1)  Positive Lyme disease (2x) Age 10 and possibly age 15 (equivocal test and never received antibiotics- (SEE ATTACHED report)

2) High pain threshold. (discovered after clavicle fracture (moderately severe) at 11 years old.  ER doctor indicated an underreaction to the severity of the fracture. 

3)  2-3 concussions in football,( 2014-15)

4)  Emergency Room for rash all over back, face, high fever, head ache, neck pain (Viral Exanthem) Spinal tap for Meningitis was negative (2015) C-reactive protein 7.97 HIGH (See Attachment)

5)  Diagnosed Ehlers-danlos hyper-mobility type (2015) SEE ATTACHMENT

6) Renaulds Phenomenon (2014)

7) Fasciculations in lower extremities (2016) (Biological Father has Fabry disease with same phenomenon)

8) Flat feet (NO parent and NO siblings have flat feet)

9) High palate and smaller teeth for his size (NO parent and NO siblings have this)

10) Celultiis (severe) in leg from insect bite (unknown) while walking in summer (2018) ER gave him intravenous antibiotics for an afternoon (POST- psychosis) 

11) Legs weak, loss of muscle mass (continuing)

PRIOR to ANY ILLNESS (psychiatric or other)
Naturally muscular, performed in lead roles in drama in school and on local television, violin in the school orchestra, composed music on multiple instruments. guitar, bass, violin, played music in public, energetic, worked out. Also ADD diagnosis in Middle school. (not physically hyper, except in his own mind) 

Then, leg pain and hip pain began (age 17) Was diagnosed with Ehlers-Danlos due to flexibility and report of joint pain.  

Age 19, was prescribed Cymbalta for depression, and became manic shortly after. Subsequently, a Bi-polar diagnosis was suspected. This seemed possible as he was spontaneous, risk-taker, musical, inspired, yet scattered, often staying up all night composing music. And then having periods of tiredness and lethargy and perhaps depression. It had beed suspected for years and we believe he is bi-polar.

2018 - Psychosis onset was in response to maruajana. Initial psychosis was not traumatic - Greek Gods, the origin of the universe.  Began Anti-psychotics after a couple of weeks, when psychosis would not stop. Psychosis only responded months later (during second hospitalization) with addition of Lithium to his regimen. The effect of lithium was evident within 2 days in the hospital. He quickly emerged from psychosis, whereas, with just anti-psychotics (even at increasing levels) there was not an adequate response. 

BLOODWORK-
Chronic (for 7 years) low Eosinophils Absolute (currently 0.0) Range: 0.12-0.30
VERY LOW Eosinophils % (0.0%) Range: 1-4% 

Chronic VERY Low Lymphocytes Absolute (0.74) Range 1.10-4.80 
Low Lymphocytes % (11%) Range: 24-44%

Chronic Low Blood Cell count  (4.1) range: 4.5-5.9
(He has always eaten red meat)

Neutorphils (on high side)

CURRENTLY:  Hearing Voices continually (8 months). Kind and gentle but getting more despondent. 

TESTING:
Last MRI was 3 years ago.
Bloodwork current
Low Vitamin D (18) range 55-135 
Abnormal EKG (April 2021) with ST abnormality 
Low T4 and Low TSH - medication perhaps, BUT his sister has the SAME issue
Genetic Test for Ehlers-Danlos did NOT find he was positive for any genes associated with EDS","History:

--legs weak and lost a lot of muscle mass (continuing)

--high pain threshold. (we discovered this when he broke his clavicle (moderately severe) when 9 years old and the doctor was shocked after seeing the X-ray that he did not have a more intense reaction to the pain.","Father - Fabry Disease(enhanceable type)

Mother - Hashimotos, Thyroid cancer. was diagnosed in 2015, after the viral infection of this patient (virus with rash, fever and headache). Viruses can enter a diseased thyroid of another person and cause Sub-acute Thyroiditis.

Younger brother - Ehlers-danlos and Renauld's Phenomenon. Stong, tennis player. 

Younger sister - Fabry disease, Ehlers-danlos (most likely)  Low T4 and Low TSH. Was anemic and had a Ferritin level of 7 due to an eating disorder. She is better.  She is a professional ballet dancer at a top company. 

Mother and Father did a genetic test after a doctor asked if they could be related. According to 23andMe parents are NOT related.

Then he got ill.","Last MRI was unremarkable and done in 2018

EKG (April 2021) needs more assessment. Showed Abnormal ST","My brain does not work like it used to. My judgment is off. My life is gone as it was. I will lose everything. And have already lost so much. I was going to music school in Nashville. I was a musician, a poet, a writer. Now, I don't recognize myself. All that I am being treated for is psychosis. But the psychiatrists' pills do not work. 

My intelligence is dropping drastically and I don't know why. There is nothing that makes it better. There is nothing that works. My incredible smart girlfriend has been with me for 5 years. But how much can she take? She and my family and friends are trying but I am someone else now.","This family has been ripped to ribbons with difficult to diagnose disease. Father was ill for years, then diagnosed with Fabry (yet strong and healthy in appearance), two sons have Ehlers-Danlos, daughter has Ehlers-Danlos and unexplained thyroid issues Low T4 and Los TSH (controlled now as she is a professional ballet dancer). All family members are slim, appear fit and appear healthy. 


2015- Mother had a Sub-Acute Thyroid attack (presented as left-sided weakness, confusion and seizure like- symptoms). Never ill before, slim and excellent physical condition. This occurred one week after Mason was brought into the ER with un-explained rash (severe) fever and underwent spinal tap. Suspected Viral infection with unknown specificity. Mason at the time did NOT have an Ehlers-Danlos diagnosis and the spinal tap caused a leak that resulted in severe headache and an additional ER visit and Blood patch. Bed for a week. 

Mother's thyroid issue was previously undiagnosed Hashimotos (stage 3-4) and Cancer (thyroid stage 2) Mother explains after 6 Endocrinologists, they concluded nothing was wrong and it was stress related and should see a therapist. A Hematologist re-evaluated her labs and symptoms and recommend consult with a thyroid surgeon as a priority. After thyroid removal, Cancer (papillary with follicular variant) was confirmed in two places and had spread. Hashimoto nodules throughout.  Radioiodine Cancer treatment was successful.

95542,22,Dewey,male,Caucasian/White,Virginia,United States,1987,December,2020,April,"Since early April, I have been experiencing the following (in order of most to least severe):

1.) Consistent regurgitation of food - even with a minimal/liquid diet, resulting in extreme weight loss (from ~180 to 155 pounds). Not aided by PPI/H-2 blocker medication.

2.) Intermittent upper chest pain/pressure and shortness of breath. Can last for minutes to days and can range from mild to severe (on the severe side, with rapid heart rate and discomfort so much so that my body visibly shakes when my heart beats and any activity or concentration is troublesome). This occasionally is relieved by regurgitation of food, but not always. Doctors have prescribed asthma medicine since I do have seasonal/animal allergies, but have not found any specific evidence of asthma via pulmonary function test or listening to lungs.

3.) Excessive amounts of mucus in throat. Occasionally will regurgitate substantial amount of white/darker mucus first thing in the morning. 

4.) Intermittent throat irritation, normally mild - can last hours to days and feels like there is something pushing on the inside of my throat.

5.) Persistent mild pressure in right ear.

71002,27,Lacy,female,Caucasian/White,Alabama,United States,1985,August,2018,April,"I became very sick at the beginning of April 2018. Fever, body aches, nonstop headaches (I never had headaches before this), nausea/vomiting, tingling and burning feelings running up and down my body. Everything hurt. I tested negative for the flu twice and my doctor really didn’t know what was going. I kept returning to his office every few days with no improvement and worsening symptoms. On April 24th the doctor decided to test me for RMSF and Lyme disease just to rule them out. He also sent me to the ER for a CT scan because I was experiencing the worst headache I had every experienced up to that point (but boy did they got so much worse). CT Scan was normal but the labs came back positive for RMSF and Lyme Disease. I got those results on May 1 2018 and I began doxycycline. Still running a fever every day I continued taking doxy for I believe 21 straight days. Still running a fever and barely able to walk from all the pain I was in, I returned to doctors and taken off doxycycline and put on Ceftin for 10 days. During that 10 days I finally stopped running a fever. Still felt horrible. The nonstop headaches were now turning into migraines. I was (and still am) having 3-5 migraines a week. To speed this along, I ended up testing positive for RMSF 2 more times (all of the positive results were IgM only), positive for Lyme (negative western blot) and had a weak positive for Lupus. I repeatedly asked my doctors if the positive test for RMSF could be a false positive and I was told no. I asked them why is it still IgM only? IgG antibodies should have shown up and I had taken enough doxycycline to kill a horse. There’s no way I still have it plus it’s not chronic. They didn’t have any answers for me. I called doctors throughout the state of Alabama and they refused to see because they had not clue, didn’t treat RMSF patients or just flat out did not return my call or my doctor’s calls. So with no answers I sought out experts in tick borne illnesses. I sent my records to Johns Hopkins and 11 days later they called me and wanted to see me the next day! I live in Alabama and that wasn’t possible. So we scheduled the appointment for the following week. In the middle of December I boarded a plane and flew to Baltimore where I saw an infectious disease doctor at Johns Hopkins. He and a team of experts had already reviewed my medical records. He explained that I had some very interesting labs. He confirmed what I had been thinking, that I do not and did not have RMSF or Lyme disease. All those test were false positives. He told he thought that I had POTS and he also thought that an autoimmune disease was the reason for all my false positives. I flew home not with a diagnosis but with answers and direction of where to look. 
In February I went to the Mayo Clinic and had more test than I name performed. Finally I tested negative for RMSF and I was still testing positive for Lyme disease and this time the Western Blot was positive for a new infection. I also showed signs of small fiber neuropathy. I tested negative for POTS but I was still taking beta blockers to get my extremely high rate down so that messed with those results. I also tested positive for anticardiolipin antibodies. They told me to have that rechecked in a few months. I had to leave the Mayo Clinic before I could finish any further testing but the doctors were sure that UAB could handle the additional testing I needed. 
In May I finally was able to get into with an  autonomic neurologist at UAB. The Mayo Clinic had suggested testing for small fiber neuropathy and a paraneoplastic panel. After I explained to the doctor that during the tilt table test at the Mayo Clinic I was still on the beta blockers he decided to retest me but this time I’d be off the beta blockers a week prior to the test. The tilt table test results showed that I have POTS but he said it was a very mild case and wouldn’t be causing any of my issues. It’s important to note that I was still having horrible migraines 3-5 days a week and a constant headache on days that I didn’t have a migraine. Along with all the horrible pain all over. Electric shocks and painful burning pains were running up and down my body. I had a skin biopsy and came back positive for Small Fiber Neuropathy. The paraneoplastic panel showed positive for achr ganglionic neuronal Ab. We’re still trying to figure out what that means. So far we’ve ruled out cancer. I was retested and I’m still positive for anticardiolipin antibodies. 
So here I am with a diagnosis of Small Fiber Neuropathy (SNF), POTS and chronic intractable migraines. The SFN diagnosis explains the tachycardia, nerve pains (shooting and burning pains, numbness, autonomic symptoms, exhausting fatigue and all the horrible pain I feel throughout my body) but doesn’t explain the migraines or all those crazy labs. But it’s a diagnosis with an extremely painful life ahead of me. I truly believe that I have some kind of autoimmune disease that’s causing all of this and we just haven’t figured it out it.","I’ve had 3 knee surgeries while I was in high school and was told that I degenerative cartridge.

67824,7,Steve,male,Caucasian/White,Minnesota,United States,1986,May,2018,January,"I am experiencing a sensation in my head that I call ""brain fog,"" though I frequently call it a headache just because it's an easier term for people to understand. It is a sensation I've described to numerous doctors as a feeling that part of my brain feels like mud, while everything else feels like clear water. The feeling is not pain, it is a dull pressure that feels more like it is covering my brain rather than it is inside it. Almost like someone threw a weighted blanket over it and it just needs to be ripped off. Usually it feels like it's behind my left eye, in my left temple, and over the top of the left hemisphere of my head. At the peak of these headaches, I can sometimes see my pulse in my vision, and my top teeth (mostly the front) will feel a tingling/aching sensation.

The sensation clears after I sleep (6-8 hours most nights). I wake up most mornings feeling totally fine. It comes on while at work, usually slowly through the morning after I've eaten a small breakfast. It often peaks soon after I eat lunch, in fact it seems tied to eating, as it will usually subsides a few hours after lunch and return after dinner. I've tested my blood sugar at the peak and it is completely normal. I have normal blood sugar levels, normal thyroid, 112/74 blood pressure. I drink plenty of fluids, usually a morning coffee and water throughout the day. When the sensation is happening, and it's almost every weekday to varying degrees, I have a hard time thinking; I get words stuck on the tip of my tongue; my focus and motivation plummet; I feel like someone turned my dimmer switch down.

There are things that I can do to help: I can exercise, I can be up and active. The more active I am, the less this is an issue, which is why I think it's so much better on weekends, when I don't have an hour commute each way and 10 hours at a desk. 

In 2019, a neurologist suggested this could be chronic sinusitis. I had a CT and they found a deviated septum and inflamed sinuses. I had surgery in April of that year and it helped. I had had facial pressure then in addition to the brain fog, and the surgery cured the facial pressure. I had a different job then, with a much shorter commute and more time to exercise, and it all started feeling better. Working remotely through the pandemic, I was much more active as well and the headaches were much less frequent. I recently moved for a new job, for another couple of months I have a long commute, and all this sedentary time has seemed to bring back my headaches.

Whatever is going on seems to definitely be related to my activity level and eating, maybe stress levels, maybe amount of sleep. The CT scan for sinusitis also turned up that I have one slightly enlarged ventricle, so we followed up with two MRIs spaced out over a year and it was ruled a congenital variation; it's not growing. Everything else in the MRIs were normal. I have tested negative for Lyme.

I do not do drugs and I have a glass of wine or equivalent 1-3x/week.","I have had a few surgeries:

Tonsils and adenoids at age ~5.
Gynecomastia at age 19.
Chronic sinusitis at age 32.
Ruptured achilles tendon at age 35. (2021)

History of asthma, more as a child than adult. 

Allergic to tree nuts and shellfish.","Maternal mother had breast cancer but was cured. Maternal grandfather died of leukemia. 

Paternal grandfather died of heart attack complications at 99.
Paternal grandmother died of DVT following time in bed suffering from chronic fatigue syndrome at 64.
Paternal aunt suffers from sever chronic fatigue syndrome.

Sister has history of migraines, receives botox injections. Brother is healthy.

Father has severe asthma, otherwise healthy. Mother is healthy.","I have a medium-stress job in finance, holding a B.A. and Ivy League M.B.A. Father of two young children. Usually active lifestyle, running ~15miles/week minimum. Have not been very active recently as I'm recovering from an achilles tendon rupture that occurred in April 2021. Low alcohol use. Not a drug user, though smoked marijuana regularly in college ~15 years ago. Went my 20s without these symptoms.","MRI of brain, most recent in 2019, was normal other than confirming congenital slightly enlarged ventricle.

CT scan of head confirming chronic sinusitis. Fixed with surgery. No followup imaging.

26363,11,Dwight,male,Caucasian/White,Florida,United States,1984,November,2018,May,"Originally started seeing floaters in my right eye that were actively ""swimming"" inside my eye. Symptoms started in a few weeks after I swallowed fresh lake water when I visited Texas. In a few months I started seeing multiple active floaters that were moving on its own (outside of the normal eye movement inertia). Both of my eyes now look like fish bowls with tiny microscopic worms that move very fast and chaotic and longer thread-looking worms that either stay still or move very slow inside my eyes. All of these worms look clear inside my eyes, I see through them. I also see tiny circles with a single dot inside my eyes. In about a year I started to develop eye discharge. It was clear, but later I started to notice more and more gunk/goo. I started to wash my eyes and I now wash them at least 5-7 times every day because gunk blocks my vision and glues my eyelids together. I constantly feel crawling sensation under my eyelids. At the end of 2020 I started to pull white threads from under my eyelids and from the surface of my eyes. When you put them into a cup of water they look like white thin ribbons/tapes. They are extremely sticky/gooey. These white thin tapes usually stretch inside the eye lid from one corner of the eye to another and they extend beyond the corner of the eye deeper inside behind the eye. 
I do have other symptoms that correlate with parasitic infection: anal itch, extreme fatigue, vitamin B-12 and vitamin D deficiency. These white threads clearly know the time of the day. They activate during night time, from midnight to 6:00am I start to feel extreme crawling under my eye lids and I can pull out dozens of them every night. During the daytime crawling sensation under my eyelids and white threads are still present, but usually less intensive. Discharge is constant. Eyes are always irritated blood-shot, very similar to pink eye from the outside. 
My saliva is also gooey/sticky. I constantly feel excessive mucus in my mouth. 
All of my symptoms are constant. Different foods, different locations, different beds, clothes, seasons,  places of residence, sleep schedules, physical activities produce no significant changes in my symptoms. 

Multiple visits to Johns Hopkins Wilmer Eye Institute did not result in a productive diagnosis. I also visited Mayo Clinic and Bascom Palmer in Naples, FL. Both did not result in a diagnosis. I went to Bascom Palmer last week and new images clearly show white thin ribbon/tape looking object in my right eye. Ultrasound shows dozens of floaters inside both eyes, which isn't normal for my age. Doctors do not know what it is and do not know what to do with it. I need to see a qualified parasitologist, but finding one if Florida or in the U.S. seems to be close to impossible. 

I had infected my ex-girlfriend. She now has sticky eye discharge and exactly the same symptoms: floaters inside her eyes, crawling sensation under her eyelids, anal itch. My theory that I infected her when we were kissing since I have mucus in my saliva.","I had GERD, hiatal hernia.

80412,5,Sarah,female,Caucasian/White,Tennessee,United States,2020,October,2021,January,"Patient reflux began at two months, which improves with famotidine but no noticeable effect with lansoprazole.  Began itching arms and face at four months when switched to elemental formulas.  Severe reflux on elemental formulas, somewhat managed with medication and thickening of formula.  Worsening reflux, irritability, and sleep when purees introduced at six months.

Switched to corn free dairy-based partially hydrolyzed formula at eight months which resolved reflux and itching symptoms, but patient began to sleep poorer and refused all purees and finger foods soon after switch.  Slowly introduced pea protein-based formula at 11 months, but could never fully switch due to severe itching and reflux caused by it.  Until 16 months, was split on those two formulas, but the dairy-based formula seemingly caused stomach pain and the pea protein-based formula caused severe itching and reflux.  The two formulas were seemingly causing two different types of allergic reactions.  Up until 16 months had normal development with speech and other skills with the exception of feeding.

Switched to almond-based formula at 16 months.  Began accepting purees again.  Soon after, had month long ear infection along with worsening itching, paleness, decrease in energy, poor sleep, stomach pain, irritability, and diarrhea.  Symptoms would cycle through the day with her symptoms best in the morning with worsening itching, reflux, burning back, and irritability later in the day peaking soon after midnight.  Has spoken very little and fallen behind in speech development since this point.

At 17 months, began Hydroxyzine in evening and saw significant improvement with itching, better sleep, reduced irritability and clinginess, and occasionally being more verbal.  The diarrhea persisted, so switched back to elemental formula at 18 months, which significantly improved the diarrhea and stomach problems, but once again caused severe reflux and continued with the severe itching.  Around the same time, added Zyrtec for allergy symptoms, which showed much of the same significant improvements as Hydroxyzine.  Patient is unable to function without antihistamine medications.  In preparation for skin prick testing, she was taken off of Hydroxyzine and Zyrtec.  That day, she had numerous upper body, neck, and face spasms/jerking motions believed by doctors seeing the video to be reflux pain.  These spasms resolved themselves when patient was put back on these medicines.

Also at 18 months, had more severe allergic reactions to a new elemental formula and Fluocinolone Acetonide about 10 minutes after ingesting or applying topically.  The elemental formula reaction resulted in unexplained irritability, dizziness, more rapid breathing, and itching of nose.  The Fluocinolone reaction resulted in dizziness and appearance of nearly passing out.  Neither reaction required emergency help but where the most severe reactions to date.  Ingredients of peanuts, corn, and potato involved in these more severe allergic reactions have previously not shown up as positive on skin prick testing.

Currently, patient is on elemental formula while eating a few purees.  Still has a moderate amount of itching of body, eyes, and mouth.  Reflux is very poorly controlled on the elemental formula.  Still has delayed reactions to most solids that she tries.  She is generally a happy child, but the underlying allergies have been gradually getting worse the past six months and we may no longer have the ability to increase her antihistamines with the doses she’s already at.",Patient was born at 5 lbs. 12 oz. at 38 weeks.

Has tried over 30 foods with delayed reactions to most purees one to two days later presenting with worsening reflux, itching, irritability, and poor sleep; and gagging, swallowing, and vomiting problems with finger foods.

scope: same
polysomnography: (very) mild AHI.  Notably, oxygen saturation never dips meaningfully below 90","Solutions tried so far:
0) Oxymetazoline LT use -- completely resolves issue without noticeable costs, but after 2-3 months tolerance builds so have to administer mid-sleep and during daytime
1) Cessation of OTC decongestant (on theory that this is mostly just Rhinitis Medicamentosa) -- done multiple times both with and w/out substitute/codose of saline nasal rinse and nasal corticosteroid (fluticasone furoate); complaint sporadically resurfaces even 1-2 months post complete cessation of decongestant
2) Change environment -- possible that complaint is less frequent when I am away from home, hard to tell if this is just random
3) OTC internal nasal dilator -- possible mild improvement experienced (https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/mute-snoring-review#does-it-work)
4) Nasal rinse and/or corticosteroid (independent of oxymetazoline) -- possible mild improvement.
5) CPAP machine -- fairly poor tolerance, limited net benefit over 2 weeks chiefly because still difficult to breathe through nose

Possible further solutions I know of:
6) Filter bedroom air and remove possible mild mold/dust on ceiling
7) Adjust breathing habits/patterns
8) Mandibular advancement device (on theory that complaint is really caused by constellation of problems, not just nasal congestion)
9) Radiofrequency turbinate reduction of inferior turbinates
10) Surgical reduction of the same -- mainly concerned about Empty Nose Syndrome.

Of note, the only time when I do not feel pain is when I exercise (typically yoga or hill repeats on my bicycle).  Driving or riding in a car aggravates symptoms.  Heat and movement seems to alleviate pain. Pain is always greatest in the late afternoon and evening - and I always feel best in the morning.","I have been a healthy woman up until this happened.  I did notice some significant bloating in my lower abdomen in March but assumed that was due to my age - and it caused me no discomfort.

Patient has not had an alcoholic drink since this began - but before typically would have 2 a week - enjoying with friends on the weekends. Patient eats very healthy meals - typically more frequent smaller meals.  Patient avoids sugary desserts and fried foods.  Since this began, patient avoids raw vegetables, spicy foods, coffee and alcohol.","Numerous tests have been done with little revealing anything.  Specific tests completed have been:

79675,15,Deedee,female,African-American,California,United States,1993,April,2014,December,"5 years ago at the age of twenty-one I experienced the first seizure of my life. Since then, I’ve had over 400 seizures, mostly the severe tonic clonic seizures that last 2 minutes. Also, since late 2014, I’ve been having almost daily migraine headaches that radiate from the back of my head to my eye sockets and I feel pressure in my head. I have to pull on my ear lobes throughout the day to relieve the feeling of pressure. 
When the seizures come, I usually have some vomiting and feel drained of energy for a few days afterwards. 

I’ve seen 8 neurologists in southern california since 2014.  They’ve done 2 brain Mri’s (both normal) and 4 EEG’s. The last EEG done at UCLA showed generalized seizure activity, the other 3 EEG’s were normal. Most of the neurologists have diagnosed me as having epilepsy..which they define as having 2 or more seizures. For the first 3 years I was prescribed the anticonvulsant Keppra but took myself off Keppra and all anticonvulsants a year and 1/2 ago because of the side effects. Since getting off Keppra, my seizures decreased from 75+ a year, to 6 or 7 most of last year until I got pregnant in August 2019. I tried 2 other anticonvulsants drugs. One gave me a seizure 30 minutes after I took it the 1st time, and a 3rd anticonvulsant I was prescribed doubled the number of seizures I was having.

In 2018 A neurologist at cedar sinai in Los Angeles, looked at the images of my 1st Mri, which was imaged the same day I had a seizure and noticed some edema. My best friend suggested fish oil to help reduce the swelling and thankfully it stopped most of the seizures. Instead of coming in clusters of 4 or 5 over a few days, now if I have a seizure, it’s just one, thanks to the fish oil.

I trace all of this nightmare back to 2013 when I had the mirena birth control iud implanted at planned parenthood. I believe with certainty the hormone they use in the mirena is responsible for the suffering I’ve been going thru. I had it removed permanently in May 2016

There’s no history of epilepsy in any of my family members. I’m religious and have never used any illegal drugs. Also, the seizures never come in the winter, only between march and october. I also have asthma and was tested for airborn allergies last year. I found out I’m allergic to the majority of pollens, mold, and even pet dander. 

I do have a few triggers that bring on a seizure. I almost always have one the day before a storm rolls in. The tonic clonic seizures always come early in the morning around 5 or 6 am. If im dehydrated I might have a seizure and i stopped alcohol at 21 because i suspected it was a trigger, but in 2017 on the 1st day of a cruise to the bahamas from florida while in stormy weather I let my guard down and had a glass of red wine at dinner. 30 minutes later in my cabin I had the 1st of 6 seizures that night, one coming every 2 hours. The next morning they kicked us off the ship in Nassau because they didn’t want to deal with it. I didn’t even have a passport.

Last year, In September of 2019, I began experiencing daily absence seizures, one every day like clockwork. I saw a local OBGYN who told me I was pregnant. Working back in time the daily absence seizures started when I was 7 weeks pregnant. I’m now into the 5th month of my pregnancy with a due date of Mid May, and the daily absence seizures continue. I was prescribed Lamotrigine by a neurologist but it doubled the absence seizures to 2 a day so I took myself off that anticonvulsant too. 

My best friend, who has been supporting me since this began 5 years ago contacted a neurosurgeon at cedar sinai 2 years ago and I finally have an appointment with him this year, in late January. He has ordered 3 mri’s of my spine I believe to investigate the possibility of a spinal fluid leak. 

I had a C section delivery and epidermal when my son was born 8 years ago, so it’s possible my dura may have been punctured by the needle. My migraines seem to be worse when I stand.
My search for an answer continues.","Lifetime asthma, gave birth to my son 8 years ago.","Diabetes, my father recently had his foot amputated due to diabetes","After high school I graduated cosmetology college, I’m a hairdresser. The seizures began within a year of graduating right after I turned 21 and got my first car.","The neurologist did 2 brain Mri’s and 4 EEG’s

The brain mri’s were normal. 

3 of the 4 EEG’s were normal, the positive EEG was for generalized seizure activity","There are no words to describe what I’m going thru. I’ve been rushed unconscious to the hospital 20 times by ambulance over the past 5 years. When I wake up, I don’t know where I am or what happened and start screaming. For every seizure that’s been documented at the hospital, I’ve had 20 more at home. I’m not allowed to drive and although I appealed the decision in court, the government says I’m not disabled and won’t approve any disability assistance. I live with my mother in law and feel I have no future and no life.
